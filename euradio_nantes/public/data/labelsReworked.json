Ils creusent &eacute;galement dans les filons du temps pour y d&eacute;nicher des p&eacute;pites, d&rsquo;ici et d&rsquo;ailleurs. On peut les trouver sous forme de vinyles aux pochettes s&eacute;rigraphi&eacute;es, au magasin Bongo Joe &agrave; Gen&egrave;ve ou dispers&eacute;s autour du globe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bongo Joe est d&rsquo;abord un magasin de disques, vinyles surtout, cassettes aussi, quelques CDs, des platines, des bouquins. C&rsquo;est &eacute;galement un lieu o&ugrave; l&rsquo;on peut voir des concerts (de poche / in-store), des conf&eacute;rences (cycle Innervision), ou simplement s&rsquo;y retrouver autour d&rsquo;un caf&eacute; ou d&rsquo;une bi&egrave;re. Bongo Joe, multifacette donc, et maison-m&egrave;re du label du m&ecirc;me nom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bongo Joe explores contemporary underground worlds to dig out instruments, voices and machines. He plows the furrows of time to unearth rare nuggets, from here and elsewhere, which you will find them in the form of vinyl records with gorgeous silk-screened covers at Bongo Joe&rsquo;s shop in Geneva or scatterered around the world&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bongojoe.ch/\">http://www.bongojoe.ch/</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BongoJoeRecords/\">https://www.facebook.com/BongoJoeRecords/</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://lesdisquesbongojoe.bandcamp.com/\">https://lesdisquesbongojoe.bandcamp.com/</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>THE ARTISTS / RECORDS</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>OK VANCOUVER OK</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/35f32e_d5098ffaebbc420d9c693b762ab72238.jpg/v1/fill/w_337,h_337,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/35f32e_d5098ffaebbc420d9c693b762ab72238.jpg\" style=\"height:337px; width:337px\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>Interview with Ok Vancouver Ok :</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"115\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://www.euradionantes.eu/embed/podcast/11379\" width=\"100%\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&laquo; Anti-capitalist indie music with an environmental message &raquo;.

Il est a l&rsquo;origine d&rsquo;une oeuvre personnelle, unique et universelle &agrave; la fois pour la premiere fois &eacute;dit&eacute; sur vinyle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">D&egrave;s l&#39;age de treize ans il commence &agrave; jouer dans un orchestre de bal puis se lance dans le bouillonnement des ann&eacute;es hippies et disco avec des groupes aux nom &eacute;vocateurs comme Les Lords, Pop Decadence, Satisfaction. Vers la fin des ann&eacute;es 1970 c&#39;est la rencontre d&eacute;cisive avec un po&egrave;te r&eacute;unionnais , Jean Albany et l&#39; adoption du cr&eacute;ole comme langue d&#39;&eacute;criture et de la musique de l&#39;ile , le maloya. Alain Peters fonde alors un nouveau groupe, Carrousel, au repertoire nourri de rythmes traditionnels et d&#39;influences plus modernes. L&#39;aventure ne durera qu&#39;un an: le d&eacute;ces de son p&egrave;re le pr&eacute;cipite un peu plus dans l&#39;alcool . Le groupe se s&eacute;pare et Alain plonge dans la marginalit&eacute;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Usant et abusant de zamal ( l&#39;herbe locale ) et d&rsquo;alcool, il vit en demi-clochard chantant sa mis&egrave;re et sa profonde tristesse aux hasard des rencontres. Une voix m&eacute;lancolique, un jeu de guitare tr&egrave;s rythmique sur une takamba , petite guitare sah&eacute;lienne, des textes doux amers chant&eacute;s en cr&eacute;ole caract&eacute;risent ses chansons. Quelques enregistrements de cette &eacute;poque subsistent. On les doit &agrave; Jean Marie Pirot,un enseignant passionn&eacute; qui, en 1981, s&rsquo;improvise directeur de studio d&rsquo;enregistrement. Pendant un an, dans son appartement, il a la patience ( les s&eacute;ances ne duraient jamais tr&egrave;s longtemps) de capturer une dizaine de merveilles &ndash; piste apr&egrave;s piste, car P&eacute;ters y joue de tous les instruments. Ce sont ces enregistrements remasteris&eacute;s avec quelques autres captur&eacute;s &ccedil;a et la que l&#39;on retrouve pour la premiere fois en vinyle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Il d&eacute;cedera d&#39;une crise cardiaque en 1995 &agrave; l&#39;age de 43 ans. &quot;Alain, il est immortel &quot; confie avec simplicit&eacute; Danyel Waro. &quot;Il a laiss&eacute; beaucoup de belles choses. C&rsquo;est une valeur po&eacute;tique et musicale. C&rsquo;est quelqu&rsquo;un que je respecte grandement. C&rsquo;est un rebelle qui ne pouvait pas s&rsquo;inscrire dans la r&eacute;alit&eacute;. C&rsquo;&eacute;tait quelqu&rsquo;un de tr&egrave;s commun et hors du commun &agrave; la fois. Il chantait sa r&eacute;alit&eacute;, son ab&icirc;me. C&rsquo;&eacute;tait un vagabond. Il n&rsquo;a pas d&rsquo;&acirc;ge. Je le sais mort depuis longtemps, mais il continue d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre en nous&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Le disque contient une s&eacute;lection de 12 morceaux tir&eacute; du r&eacute;pertoire d&rsquo;Alain Peters ins&eacute;r&eacute; dans une pochette &eacute;paisse (r&eacute;plika).

From the post rock influenced First\r\nBreath After Coma to the classic pianist Andr&eacute; Barros and stoner rock\r\ntrio Born A Lion, the label (with 360&ordm; business to the musicians)\r\nstarted to record, release, manage, booking, promote and represent a\r\nlarge number of new acts.\r\nIn the last years names as Surma, Les Crazy Coconuts, Few Fingers,\r\nTwin Transisitors, Whales and others were joining this artistic\r\nmovment.\r\nIn 2016 they are 11 bands and they made 16 releases.\r\nThey reached all the main festivals in Portugal and started to play in\r\nseveral european countries ( in the last six months of 2016 four bands\r\nfrom the label are doing more than 17 gigs outside portugal).

This is surely thanks to their previous incarnation as a high school band, where they played in moldy garages and smoky clubs, trying out their own versions of classics from bands ranging from Joy Division to the Doors and Iggy Pop to the Velvet Underground. They also worked a handful of originals into those early sets, where traces of a post-punk influence were already brewing.<br />\r\nThen they decided to stop and give it some time. Hoping to return and catch their breath. During their hiatus they discovered post-rock but never set aside the song form. A few years later, they returned full force. By 2012, they&rsquo;d already won the Fade In Festival battle of the bands ZUS!, had been booked in Monkey Week, Vodafone Mexefest, Paredes De Coura, Bons Sons, had made it to the last round of the Thermometer Festival and were also selected as FNAC new talent and released their first concept album, The Misadventures Of Anthony Knivet.<br />\r\nIn 2016 they have returned with the astonishing new album &quot;Drifter&quot; and have just been booked for Reeperbahn Festival.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile many surmise that FIRST BREATH AFTER COMA may be one of the great hopes for Portuguese music, those who have seen them live know they are already a blast.</p>\r\n\r\n<div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tNVOosRxpEw\" width=\"800\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>More infos : <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/firstbreathaftercoma12/\">https://www.facebook.com/firstbreathaftercoma12/</a></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div><strong>TWIN TRANSISTORS</strong></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://omnichordrecords.com/imagem.php?data=YTo0OntzOjM6ImltZyI7czo0NDoiaW1hZ2Vucy83ODk0Y2YyODA5OGQ5OTYzNWZkMGM3MmYwZTQyODdjNy5qcGciO3M6NToid2lkdGgiO3M6MzoiNDI4IjtzOjY6ImhlaWdodCI7czowOiIiO3M6NDoiY3JvcCI7YjowO30=\" style=\"height:428px; width:428px\" /></strong></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>Founded by two members of the Allstar Project, The Twin Transistor&rsquo;s sound was initially characterized by synthesizers and keyboards, having been heavily influenced by Sonic Boom/Spectrum, LCD Soundsystem and also incorporated hints of experimentalism.<br />\r\nBetween 2009 and 2013, several members came and went, and it was only in 2014 that the band coalesced into its current line-up.

They learned early on that a recreational center in their town without any neighbors was an ideal rehearsal space, and rehearse they did. When the Ducks got into the studio they were able to record their entire album in one weekend.<br />\r\nIn 2012, they released a first single by the same title (pronounced &ldquo;twenty twelve&rdquo;), followed by the track Back to the Future. When they released their debut album Quack, they were already on their third single, Bollywood.<br />\r\nAfter several thousand downloads of Quack, the physical edition quickly sold out and a second edition will follow in early 2016, with the second album.<br />\r\nIn 2013 they provided the opening track on the New Talents of FNAC compilation, played several festivals as Vodafone Mexefest and Bons Sons and conquered the Spanish Festival Monkey Week, where they received excellent reviews and radio play.<br />\r\nAfter some time spent in Punta Cana, they discovered real love and in 2016 they have returned to recorded the new &quot;Love Is You And Me Under The Night Sky&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"318\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rTGmggrWc4Y\" width=\"565\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>More infos : <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/nwfdofficial/\">https://www.facebook.com/nwfdofficial/</a></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div><strong>LES CRAZY COCONUTS</strong></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://omnichordrecords.com/imagem.php?data=YTo0OntzOjM6ImltZyI7czo0NDoiaW1hZ2Vucy82OWExMjI1YTdkNDIzZDBmNTczZGM3NDIwOTI3OWE5My5qcGciO3M6NToid2lkdGgiO3M6MzoiNDI4IjtzOjY6ImhlaWdodCI7czowOiIiO3M6NDoiY3JvcCI7YjowO30=\" style=\"height:428px; width:428px\" /></strong></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>Tap dancing and indie rock tunes at the same time.<br />\r\nEccentric and amazing way of approaching music.<br />\r\nIndie tapdancing?

From rock to dance, in live performances the Crazy Coconuts are a revelation and have already been called the best Portuguese band of 2014 by the jury of the Thermometer Festival as well as considered by Antena 3 to be one of the three best Portuguese bands following the National Battle of the Bands. In addition to having performed at the Spanish festival Monkey Week and The Coliseum in Porto, they have been booked in various festivals in 2015 (including NOS Alive, Paredes de Coura and Indie Music Fest).

Just like the most revered, political records of the 60s and 70s, the third album </span><span style=\"color:#222222\"><em>Animal Races</em></span><span style=\"color:#222222\"> channels the past, the present and the future with an authentically fresh psych-rock take on American society through its own neo-cosmic language.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;<em>San Francisco has always been great and hopefully always will be but these days there are things we despise,&rdquo; </em><span style=\"color:#222222\">tells Ghoul guitarist and vocalist Pat McDonald, &ldquo;</span><em>the lifestyle The Bay once afforded artists has been decimated. This gold-rush of the tech industry is forcing prices up and it&rsquo;s been a flood of bullshit. Some people are being forcibly displaced, others are disheartened and leave by choice. Our song &lsquo;Never You Mind&rsquo; is a reminder to the creative community not to roll over. San Francisco isn&rsquo;t dead until you let it die in your heart.</em>&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s impossible to separate Cool Ghouls from their adopted hometown. Whether playing dollar dice games and shooting pool or stepping out for a walk through the Californian hills, this is a band who swapped their young lives in stripmall suburbia to settle in the Shaky City of their electric heroes. The place where Gram Parsons&rsquo; Flying Burrito Brothers unwittingly inspired lesser-known <span style=\"color:#222222\">followers of the Cosmic American gospel to commit readings to tape, Cool Ghouls slot right in the city&rsquo;s rich musical lineage.</span> Pat M, with Pat Thomas (bass/vocals), Ryan Wong (guitar/vocals), and Alex Fleshman (drums), made their own celestial pilgrimage to their place of worship and have established themselves as one of the city&rsquo;s brightest young bands playing, against the backdrop of a chaotic big city, a laid-back psych-rock sound for the here and now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those who fell for the raw, primitive sound of the band&rsquo;s 2014 album <em>A Swirling Fire Burning Through the Rye (Empty Cellar Records / Burger Records) </em>recorded with local hero Sonny Smith of Sonny And The Sunsets, will be pleasantly surprised by the Ghouls&rsquo; latest evolution in sound. This time recorded with melodic maestro Kelley Stoltz in his backyard Electric Duck studio, the album was mixed and mastered by Mikey Young (Total Control / Eddy Current Suppression Ring), and features full-colour artwork by Shannon Shaw of Shannon and The Clams.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#222222\">&ldquo;</span><span style=\"color:#222222\"><em>Animal Races is the harvest of work we created between last year&rsquo;s tours, working in bars, record stores and coffee shops,&rdquo; </em></span><span style=\"color:#222222\">says Pat M.</span><span style=\"color:#222222\"><em> &ldquo;We chose the title because the song&rsquo;s lyrics are a broad characterization of society. So any track on the album, whether it be about love, personal growth, death or whatever, takes place in the setting of the &lsquo;animal races&rsquo; &ldquo;.</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commenting just as much on the individual&rsquo;s place in society as the San Francisco community itself, the theories of &lsquo;self-actualization&rsquo; and &lsquo;anima&rsquo; by Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung about achieving individual potential pervade &lsquo;If I Can&rsquo;t Be The Man&rsquo; and &lsquo;Material Love&rsquo;. Whether time-hopping from the summer of love on &lsquo;Sundial&rsquo; or channelling the freewheeling feeling of The Grateful Dead and Canned Heat through loud guitars, acid riffs, party screams, and stacked-as-f*ck three-part vocal harmonies, each of <em>Animal Races&rsquo; </em>11 tracks bring the four-piece&rsquo;s electrifying live performances to life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&lsquo;Time Capsule&rsquo; is about exactly this, explains Pat T; <em>&ldquo;</em><em>when you replay a recorded track, that little chunk of time is brought into the current moment. This is especially true of a recording of a live performance. &lsquo;Time Capsule&rsquo; was designed to open the door for improvisation and is the encapsulation of just one version of this song, each version specific to the one time we play it. It&rsquo;s going to change a lot as we play it over the years.&rdquo;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a band who, just like society and the world itself, is constantly evolving, Cool Ghouls are the perfect antidote for San Francisco&rsquo;s current state of mind, providing the real-life soundtrack whilst not letting the city&rsquo;s culture be burned to the ground.</p>\r\n\r\n<div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nUgD0tDExGA\" width=\"854\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>More infos : <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/coolghouls/\">https://www.facebook.com/coolghouls/</a></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div><strong>STEPHEN STEINBRICK</strong></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.melodic.co.uk/word/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/melo108-315x315.jpg\" style=\"height:315px; width:315px\" /></strong></div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p>After more than ten years of touring and secluded home recording, Stephen Steinbrink has cataloged several albums worth of gorgeous melody, quotidian dread and desert blight in his stark, minimal pop. Yet the songs on his latest record Anagrams, beautiful yet unflinching portraits of addiction and mental illness are captured in his most meticulous and high-fidelity production to date. While one might expect the record to be a final destination, a tidy hi-res culmination of all this journeying, the album&rsquo;s particularly varied styles and sincere lyrical uncertainty portray a search that still continues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;While making Anagrams I felt like I was losing it,&rdquo; Stephen says. &ldquo;Lately writing songs almost makes the world seem more chaotic, like I keep digging up re-burying the same old bone. For this album I tried to continue unpacking these forgotten images and memories, except this time without placing any subjective meaning on them, or any expectation of personal growth to occur after. Maybe it&rsquo;s silly to expect the process of making art to be a clarifying act.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stephen&rsquo;s artistic trajectory can be considered nomadic in the obvious sense: when not incessantly touring Europe and the U.S. in the last two years, he spent his stationary moments on his beloved, spaced-out west coast, writing in Olympia, Washington; Oakland, California and Phoenix, Arizona. But as a self-taught producer, audio fidelity itself proves to be an equally accurate gauge of his craft. Like many songwriters, he cut his teeth in the tape hiss and bedroom hum of lo-fi 4-track endeavors. Then in 2014, he released an unabashedly digital tableaux of subdued, heartbreaking pop, aptly titled Arranged Waves. Now, Anagrams finds him chasing melodies in the polished largesse of a proper studio.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stephen spent numerous scattered sessions over 18 months at UNKNOWN, a retrofitted studio in a lofty de-sanctified catholic church in Anacortes, Washington, intensely tracking and arranging on a wealth of analogue gear. &ldquo;The reverb in there is huge, inescapable,&rdquo; Stephen says. &ldquo;Having this expansive palette to work with was so thrilling, especially after working in my home studio for so many years, with its &lsquo;charmingly&rsquo; dysfunctional gear and rats living in the walls.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The result plays at times with the reverberating joy of The Sundays (like the elliptical psych-pop of &ldquo;Building Machines&rdquo;) and the jangly, sonorous warmth of &lsquo;80s REM found on the album&rsquo;s title track. With the help of engineer Nicholas Wilbur (Mount Eerie, Hungry Cloud Darkening) and a backing band featuring members of Mt. Eerie, LAKE, Hungry Cloud Darkening and Avi Buffalo, Anagrams&rsquo; breadth contains Pacific Northwest grunge lurches (&ldquo;Canopy&rdquo;) and a lush country meandering dissecting chaotic personality disorders (&ldquo;Dissociative Blues&rdquo;). A post-psychedelic nightmare slithers through the heart of this record, haunting the spaces between songs. &ldquo;I can see the blood behind your eyes a million times / like the finger is tracing the crown / I&rsquo;m turning inside out&rdquo; he sings on &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Turning Inside Out&rdquo; while Allyson Foster and Paul Benson whisper-chant the outro in unison, &ldquo;Am I lost between here or there?&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Outside the studio, Stephen often reached for writers like Lorrie Moore (whose story collection Anagrams is a partial inspiration) who usher readers into the minds of fragmented characters with unseemly but ultimately endearing shortcomings. This is best seen on the steadfast block-rock of &ldquo;Psychic Daydream&rdquo;, where the narrator, only after many years, can gain perspective and console a splintered self. Stephen sings: &ldquo;You left reality, 2002 / thought that everyone was hating you / it&rsquo;s only now that you see it clear / you had a lot to fear.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most ambitious of Stephen&rsquo;s pop songcraft, Anagrams is ultimately an unpacking of identity. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care about continuing in a tradition of songwriters, and I rarely intentionally self-identify as one. I always wonder if my most recent song is the last one I&rsquo;ll ever write. I try to be more concerned with being open, to imagine myself as a rock or a wrapper or nothing at all. Whenever I can get close to that state of mind the songs come easy, but it seems arbitrary, almost like they would&rsquo;ve existed with or without me. I think it&rsquo;s a noble pursuit, to try to be nothing.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An effort, ongoing.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PaR3GBXqEI4\" width=\"560\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>More infos :&nbsp; <a href=\"http://www.melodic.co.uk\">http://www.melodic.co.uk</a></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div><strong>THE DRINK</strong></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.melodic.co.uk/word/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/MELO102-315x315.jpg\" style=\"height:315px; width:315px\" /></strong></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Playing things safe has never been The Drink&rsquo;s philosophy. Throughout the trio&rsquo;s evolution, their gloriously off-kilter guitar pop melodies and lyrical curiosities have commanded attention &ndash; and on brand new album Capital, they&rsquo;re pushing the boundaries even further, eschewing meticulous planning in favour of instinct across even more wondrously intriguing tracks. &ldquo;Capital can mean a lot of things&rdquo; explains Galway born singer Dearbhla Minogue. &ldquo;But it always has a gravity wherever it crops up. It brings to mind subtle or intangible force.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taking their celebration of controlled chaos out of the city (the trio all now reside in London), and into the Yorkshire countryside, Capital was recorded in a converted pig farm just outside Sheffield and is the next intrepid step in The Drink&rsquo;s defiant rolling trajectory. The band&rsquo;s &lsquo;debut&rsquo; album Company was compiled from their first three EPs, received praise across the music press and set off twelve months of touring that culminated in a BBC 6music session for Marc Riley, support slots with Toro Y Moi and invites to the Green Man and End Of The Road festivals this summer. Whilst most would put writing a follow-up on hold to fulfil their live duties, that simply wasn&rsquo;t an option: &ldquo;We wanted to move on fast after Company, without that momentum-sapping two-year gap between albums,&rdquo; explains bassist David Stewart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With drummer Daniel Fordham completing the line-up, if there&rsquo;s one thing Capital has, it&rsquo;s momentum. Through skewed time signatures and rapid key changes, whether drawing influences from krautrock (see the hypnotic &lsquo;Like A River&rsquo; and &lsquo;No Memory&rsquo;s motorik drones) to girl group harmonics (Dearbhla&rsquo;s cherubic falsetto on &lsquo;Roller&rsquo; and &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll Never Make You Cry&rsquo;), time on tour has given the trio the chance to develop their impressive sound, giving way to a natural confidence and chemistry that has found its way into Capital&rsquo;s song-writing. &lsquo;Potter&rsquo;s Grave&rsquo;, in particular, highlights the album&rsquo;s wonderfully strange collision between beautiful fragments of melody and lyrical imagery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With a style that deftly evokes feeling over understanding, Dearbhla&rsquo;s lyrics provide emotion to an uninhibited stream of unconsciousness, whether conjuring up references to dreams and sleep, or to nature, inspired by the folk songs she used to listen to and the poetry of Ted Hughes, Dylan Thomas, and her great uncle Frank Thompson. &ldquo;I wrote &lsquo;No Memory&rsquo;s&rsquo; phrase &lsquo;dreaming of a green field&rsquo; after a flashbulb dream about the green fields back home&hellip; but I think a lot of my lyrical references to nature are allegorical to how far away from their own nature people have to behave now, in order to survive.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mixed and mastered by Tobias Warwick Jones, Capital exhibits the band&rsquo;s appreciation of artists from The Modern Lovers to Rory Gallagher. The result is a record that transcends its predecessor, bolstered by playful danceability. Take the disco-infused &lsquo;You Won&rsquo;t Come Back At All&rsquo;, born from a night out dancing in Whitechapel, whilst lead track &lsquo;The Coming Rain&rsquo; is the result of years spent listening to Kenyan Ayub Ogada. Elsewhere the nervy blues guitar sound of &lsquo;Hair Trigger&rsquo; and &lsquo;Like A River&rsquo; are driven by what Dearbhla calls a &lsquo;got-to-catch-my-train feel&rsquo;. &ldquo;We only found the right guitar sound about an hour before I had to leave for my train and I wanted to record as many tracks as possible with that sound. It was a bit down to the wire but it&rsquo;s given the record an energy we wouldn&rsquo;t have otherwise had&rdquo; she says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Between them, the band members have other projects; Dearbhla continues to play in The Wharves and Shield Your Eyes, whose guitarist Stef Ketteringham has hugely influenced Dearbhla&rsquo;s playing. Daniel has recently collaborated with award-winning short-story writer Stuart Evers, creating soundscapes inspired by the writer&rsquo;s latest collection, Your Father Sends His Love.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The band has shape-shifted as a sort of evolving unit into something which is now a bit less cerebral and more instinctive. We always knew it was more than the sum of its parts from the beginning, but I don&rsquo;t think any of us expected to be improvising takes in the studio.&rdquo; Showcasing Dearbhla&rsquo;s beguiling lyrics, Capital is the sound of The Drink harnessing their groove and moving their sound to new, unexplored places.</p>\r\n\r\n<div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GYNS9C5cJc4\" width=\"854\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>More infos : <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/thedrinkthedrink/\">https://www.facebook.com/thedrinkthedrink/</a></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div><strong>WORKING FOR A NUCLEAR FREE CITY</strong></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.melodic.co.uk/word/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/melo104-wfanfc-315x315.jpg\" style=\"height:315px; width:315px\" /></strong></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Working for a Nuclear Free City have never been too concerned with genre. Since their debut release almost a decade ago they have danced around the constraints of genre, eschewing predictability and expectation in the process by creating a body of work dictated by invention and momentum. Their latest release is no exception although, like much of their previous work, whilst it is difficult to pinpoint it is not lacking in stylistic coherence, &ldquo;When putting the record together I was trying make something cohesive in some way.&rdquo; Says one of the group&rsquo;s founding members, Phil Kay. The end result is an expansive, pop-tinged, experimental album that can be as propulsive as it can be restrained, bringing to mind artists as diverse and brilliant as Brian Eno to the Super Furry Animals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The situations and inspiration around the record have been rather hodgepodge, &ldquo;I listen to the radio most of the time, stations that play pretty diverse things, or I put things on shuffle a lot &ndash; mainly just trying to take the decision making process out of what I choose to listen too&rdquo; Kay says, whilst also stating that the environments in which the record were created were just as all over the place, &ldquo;I move around a lot so all the tracks are from different areas. Some from back in Manchester, a few from here in London, a couple I recorded in LA up in the Hollywood hills in Jennifer Anniston&rsquo;s old apartment.&rdquo; This geographically vast record was also done over a period of time too, making it a continent-spanning record that has had years&rsquo; worth of thoughts and ideas funnelled into it, &ldquo;It was recorded over such a long period of time that each track has its own distinct memories for me.&rdquo; Kay says of the process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The title of the album What Do People Do All Day? Has a dual meaning, as Kay points out, &ldquo;I was writing a kids book at the time so had loads of Richard Scarry books lying around. I think we hit on the title as it of course reminds you&nbsp;of Scarry and puts you in that playful territory but the second meaning of it is about the mundanity and futility of life, so there&rsquo;s that juxtaposition. It was supposed to be this loose concept album about peoples lives or various snapshots of people lives. The songs also all seem to relate to these imagined characters and their lives &ndash; perhaps a days in their lives&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a result the songs vary enormously and when discussing what some of the individual tracks are about, Kay paints a picture of a little universe of strange tales and stories, one song is about &ldquo;Media and politics and bullshit and living in a city and everyone wired up and concrete and adverts and too much noise&rdquo; whilst others are about: &ldquo;A girl who dreams of killing her boss, quitting her mundane job and living in a magazine&rdquo;; &ldquo;The heir to Blackpool Pleasure Beach who turns it into a Vegas-style resort, makes millions, moves to Venice beach and turns it into Blackpool&rdquo; and &ldquo;Teenagers getting stoned in a park in suburbia and discovering a secret portal&rdquo;. As illustrated by these unique and vast narrative situations, it&rsquo;s an album with huge scope and one that has set out to be as lyrically ambitious as it is sonically.</p>\r\n\r\n<div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uP9pxFPVuHo\" width=\"854\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>More infos :&nbsp; <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/wfanfc/\">https://www.facebook.com/wfanfc/</a></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div><strong>MAN OF MOON </strong></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.melodic.co.uk/word/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MELO107-Web-315x315.jpg\" style=\"height:315px; width:315px\" /></strong></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Medicine can be different things to different people; it can be good, bad, drugs, a cure, the answer or the problem.&rdquo; Says Chris Bainbridge, one half of Edinburgh-based Mon of Moon when discussing the title of the band&rsquo;s debut EP. Mikey Reid makes up the other half of the group who, at 19 years old, decided to quit college and pursue music, such was the deep-set sonic bond the two had made when fusing their ideas and talents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2015 they released their debut single, led by the A-side of &lsquo;The Road&rsquo;, it was a gliding, motortik-driven piece of neo pop psychedlia, produced by Frightened Rabbit&rsquo;s Andy Monaghan. Picking up a healthy dose of critical and fan acclaim along the way, the band had also pricked ears of other fellow Scottish groups, such as The Phantom Band and the Twighlight Sad, the latter of whom invited the duo on tour, twice. On this EP they return to working with Monaghan, &ldquo;It was a lot easier getting takes down on this EP, we went into the studio more confident and ready to record again. After having worked with Andy before, it was easier to work with him for a second time.&rsquo; Says Bainbridge</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s a confidence that shines throughout the EP&rsquo;s four tracks. The shimmering psych glow of their previous material being developed into more structured, multifaceted, textured and slightly more aggressive songs, &ldquo;We had been listening to a lot more heavier stuff before we went into the studio. It wasn&rsquo;t intentional to make it heavier, we are still writing songs with atmospheric elements. This EP just represents the louder side of our music.&rdquo; Whilst there are unquestionably louder moments there too are more sombre, quieter moments too, songs that reside in states of tranquillity and reflection, allowing gentle guitar lines to linger amongst the thick ambience of the production. Given some of the themes of the EP, such pace, space and occasional pathos is understandable, &ldquo;The EP is about my family, my pals and loss. The sea is a running theme throughout music.&rdquo; Says Bainbridge who grew up in a small coastal dwelling on Scotland&rsquo;s East Coast. In the same way the moon influences our tides, the ebb and flow of the North Sea is a constant inspiration for the group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Man of Moon are still in a formative state as a band but they already feel like they have slipped seamlessly into the rich lineage of British guitar music that precedes them, Medicine feels like the next step up the mountain, which only adds to the brimming sense of excitement and anticipation as to where this band will go next.</p>\r\n\r\n<div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/o29B1lVrWoI\" width=\"854\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>More infos :&nbsp; <a href=\"http://www.manofmoon.net/\">http://www.manofmoon.net/</a></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div><strong>MICHAEL A.GRAMMAR</strong></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.melodic.co.uk/word/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/michaelagrammarcover-315x315.jpeg\" style=\"height:315px; width:315px\" /></strong></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>If Michael A Grammar&rsquo;s previous two Eps (Random Vision and Vitamin Easy) cemented how devastatingly accomplished this young band has become in the last 18 months, then their debut album &lsquo;Michael A Grammar&rsquo; (made up of those first two EPs and 4 brand new tracks) is set to confirm that good things come in threes. It&rsquo;s the Brighton four-piece&rsquo;s triumphant debut album and it brilliantly captures their sonic evolution and live prowess from conception through to the present day, and gives us a heady insight into their future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Had we set out to record everything straight away, we&rsquo;d probably have drifted into an infinite tundra of sub-satisfactory jingles and drowned early on,&rdquo; explains guitarist and singer Frankie Mockett. &ldquo;This record marks the voyage of change that has been underway since our beginning, documented in the way we know best.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whilst most young bands simply start up, make a record, and then tour it out, Michael A Grammar boast a freshness contrary to having already experienced their fair share of ups and downs. Following the release of their first Vitamin Easy EP when just 20 years old (four transcendent, psychedelic tracks of Slowdive-style sparkle that surfaced from sessions in a Victorian coach house whilst attempting to recreate lost songs from a crashed hard drive) the band&rsquo;s original bassist Daniel Ondieki was facing deportation back to his native Kenya.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Unfortunately Daniel had to leave due to visa issues with &ldquo;The Combine&rdquo;, though it could&rsquo;ve been worse had Nigel Farage been in the hot-seat with a stick up his arse,&rdquo; says Frankie. &ldquo;Thankfully we found Cl&eacute;mentine with her clothes off at a life drawing class and invited her into the family. We&rsquo;re now waiting on the fifth member&hellip;&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Michael A Grammar&rsquo;s evolving line-up was unveiled on their next installment, the Random Vision EP. Recorded in the basement of their Nottingham student house by Joel and fellow founding member Frankie Mockett (both guitar/vocals). They were joined by John Davies (drums) and French bassist Cl&eacute;mentine Blue taking over from Daniel for the live shows, her driving riffs enhanced the group&rsquo;s widescreen and stoned out jams towards a more buoyant &lsquo;not give a fuck&rsquo; blistering live show. This EP, recalling Boards of Canada&rsquo;s mind-ensconcing atmospherics, The Beta Band chowing down on ritalin or Broadcast (whose song &lsquo;Michael A Grammar&rsquo; lends the band its name) propelled them forwards. A feature on Mary Ann Hobbs&rsquo; XFM podcast ensued, as did a session for BBC 6music&rsquo;s Marc Riley, live appearances at The Great Escape and Camden Crawl followed shortly after an invite by British Sea Power to be main support on their sold out tour, an invite to play Green Man and a European autumn headline tour are next on the horizon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Marking Michael A Grammar&rsquo;s biggest progression to date, the album&rsquo;s anthemic final third (which they&rsquo;ve named collectively as the suitably intergalactic &lsquo;Lunar Sea&rsquo;) kicks off with &lsquo;Mondays&rsquo; &ndash; it skilfully sets the tone with petroleum powered melodies fired from layered Brit Pop guitars, devastating distortion and woozy vocal effects. &lsquo;Nature&rsquo;s Child&rsquo; explodes into a ambush of axe-wielding noise and &lsquo;You Make Me&rsquo; is a patchwork quilt of manipulated psychedelic organ textures and varying sources of inspiration;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The words are a mix of notes I&rsquo;d scribbled down in various places,&rdquo; Joel reveals. &ldquo;Some come from listening to Souls of Mischief; another line comes from a poem in the film Patton.&rdquo; Shifting from the DIY charm of a friend&rsquo;s old office in Portslade, Brighton, to a fully-equipped studio for the first time, the tracks were recorded live with external producer, Julian Tardo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Each part of the album is an indicator of our present,&rdquo; they say. &ldquo;Obviously as things change, so too does the music and the way it&rsquo;s recorded. As a result we feel more confident within ourselves which has inspired us to bring it back down to earth and record in the manner we did.&rdquo; All live recordings, single takes and a ferocious energy gives these tracks a contagious energy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Everything has been leading towards this moment; Michael Grammar is the story of four young friends progression personally and sonically into adulthood through their past, present and soon, their future.</p>\r\n\r\n<div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0cUC1s1VW3E\" width=\"854\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>More infos : <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/michaelagrammarband/\">https://www.facebook.com/michaelagrammarband/</a></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div><strong>DARK DARK DARK</strong></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.melodic.co.uk/word/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/MELO0101-315x315.jpg\" style=\"height:315px; width:315px\" /></strong></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s always been a hugely cinematic tone to Dark Dark Dark&rsquo;s music, be it through the immersive sense of atmosphere much of the instrumentation and vocals instill, or the image-strewn lyrics and sense of place that can transport the listener to another world. So it makes perfect sense that they would end up in the world of cinema. However, this is not simply a film score commission. Here the group&rsquo;s involvement with Flood Tide runs much, much deeper. Flood Tide is written and directed by former band member Todd Chandler, and features the band both as characters and performers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Set within artist Swoon&rsquo;s floating junk sculptures project, &lsquo;Swimming Cities of Switchback Sea&rsquo;, Flood Tide both documents and reimagines the real-life journey of Swoon and her collaborators as they build boats out of junk and set out on the open water of the Hudson River. All of this is accompanied by an original, nineteen song soundtrack by Dark Dark Dark. The film and soundtrack release comes after a fruitful and productive few years for the group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After releasing the much praised debut album on melodic &lsquo;Wild Go&rsquo; in 2011, the band followed up with full-length &lsquo;Who Needs Who&rsquo; in 2012, and then the &lsquo;What I Needed&rsquo; EP in 2013, a year that saw them tour the world, play two ATP&rsquo;s within 6 months (curated by The National and TV On The Radio), as well as create a score to Jerome Hill&rsquo;s La Cartomancienne. Flood Tide also premiered in 2013 at the Torino Film Festival, exposing the world to the group&rsquo;s rich and evocative soundtrack for the very first time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With much of Dark Dark Dark&rsquo;s previous material being glued together by the distinctive vocals of Nona Marie Invie, this soundtrack is unique in that it is primarily instrumental, an approach that motivated the group immensely. &ldquo;We were excited to have an opportunity to make an instrumental record because we&rsquo;ve always been inspired by bands like Rachel&rsquo;s and Dirty Three, and soundtracks like those from the movies Waking Life and Dead Man,&rdquo; say the band. Much like some of the influences and inspirations mentioned here, the soundtrack to Flood Tide succeeds as a stand-alone record, even when free from its contextual home of the film. &ldquo;This is a really unique record,&rdquo; the group say of the project, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s much more textural and ambient than most Dark Dark Dark material.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The line-up featured on the soundtrack is one that never toured full time, and this record is a beautiful document of the chemistry and sensibilities of that variation of the band. The group have taken the material on the road, playing it in strange, distinctive places that are emblematic of the film&rsquo;s own unique journey. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve played this material in a hand-built drive-in movie theatre filled with junk cars, on rafts on the Hudson River, in the canals of Venice and in museums across the USA.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The double gatefold vinyl release wraps up this project for the band perfectly, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re excited to have the recordings out in the world. It&rsquo;s a document of a special time in our lives. Releasing a small run of vinyl with a download of the film seems like the most beautiful and intimate way to share this project.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The film and soundtrack feature Dark Dark Dark members Nona Marie Invie, Marshall LaCount, Todd Chandler, Jonathan Kaiser, and Mark Trecka.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"340\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rMcvZKxEQX0\" width=\"560\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>More infos : <a href=\"http://brightbrightbright.com\">http://brightbrightbright.com</a></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div><strong>BOREDOM</strong></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.melodic.co.uk/word/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/BOREDOM_artwork3-315x315.jpg\" style=\"height:315px; width:315px\" /></strong></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Boredom is the potent cross pollination and sonic reaction of two particular heady strains of Salford and Amsterdam beats. Taking their name from the book by Alberto Moravia, Boredom are that strange juxtaposition where being surrounded by people can create severe isolation, their mantra &ldquo;Gotta get up and out and up and out&rdquo; is a liberating call to arms of defiance to escape all expectations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bonding over a shared love of Polish disco, 80s Japanese pop and Paradise Garage mixes, Melodic Records label manager Andy Moss and Delphic&rsquo;s James Cook unknowingly recorded their debut release over two consecutive weekends, starting in a murky Salford mill basement only surfacing early on the Monday morning to start an eventful roadtrip and ferry ride to Amsterdam, where they finished the recordings on an Overtoom townhouse rooftop.<br />\r\nAs the sun came up, Boredom was born.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been emailing each other tunes we liked for years,&rdquo; explains Cook. &ldquo;The common thread was always real musicianship woven into electronic, danceable tunes&hellip; that hint of a human being in there making mistakes that computers don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Joining the party are German House stalwarts Panthera Krause and Sandrow M who offer remixes on the Melodic 12&rdquo; house bag which includes the original workings &lsquo;Geometry&rsquo; and &lsquo;Turn Your Head&rsquo;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Sh6FoL-tOeo\" width=\"854\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>More infos : <a href=\"https://boredomuk.bandcamp.com/\">https://boredomuk.bandcamp.com/</a></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div><strong>MALCOM MIDDLETON &amp; DAVID SHRIGLEY</strong></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.melodic.co.uk/word/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/digicover-315x315.jpg\" style=\"height:315px; width:315px\" /></strong></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Blending the words and wisdom of visual artist David Shrigley with the whipsmart musicianship of songwriter and Arab Strap co-founder Malcolm Middleton, the pair&rsquo;s absurd wit and stark delivery is perfectly captured on &lsquo;Music And Words&rsquo; &ndash; a special collaboration album that started out wrong but ended up just right.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I misinterpreted the meaning of David&rsquo;s words so created a certain style of music to accompany the wrong themes,&rdquo; admits Middleton of the album&rsquo;s non-existent narrative. &ldquo;I took one song &lsquo;Sunday Morning&rsquo; to be a scathing attack on the pomp and arrogance of religion, only to be informed that it&rsquo;s just about willies and was recorded on a Sunday morning. It makes for an interesting record though&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Featuring the vocals and mimicry talent of comic actor Gavin Mitchell, the transatlantic tones of Californian friend Scott Vermeire, actor Bridget McCann and David Shrigley himself, the album was born in lieu of payment after Shrigley created artwork for Middleton&rsquo;s &lsquo;A Brighter Beat&rsquo; album &ldquo;I loved all the music Malcolm made,&rdquo; says Shrigley. &ldquo;We have similar sensibilities; we&rsquo;re both into darkness, pathos, despair; existential things. It was just what I wanted, even though I didn&rsquo;t really know what I wanted.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&lsquo;Story Time&rsquo; is the first earful from the album and boasts humour as black as the lines of Shrigley&rsquo;s drawings. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the song that started it all,&rdquo; Middleton recalls. &ldquo;Funny, disturbing, and then a bit more disturbing. It&rsquo;s a beautiful song, not just a cheap shock,&rdquo; he says, affirming the album&rsquo;s subjective nature. Or as David puts it &ldquo;The meaning is negotiable&rdquo;.But gathering source material for the pair&rsquo;s mordant style isn&rsquo;t something to have happened overnight, informs Shrigley; &ldquo;Malcolm wrote the first pieces of music in 2007 so the album has taken about seven years to make&hellip;that means it must be good, right?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Malcolm Middleton will host &lsquo;Twice! Two Nights At Tuts&rsquo; this December, which is pretty self explanatory &ndash; two gigs at Kings Tuts in Glasgow with Saturday 13th December a full band show and Sunday 14th an acoustic one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also this winter will see the umpteenth book by David Shrigley. &lsquo;Weak Messages Create Bad Situations&rsquo; is a sort of manifesto about graphic art amongst other things. It is a big heavy book and can be used to press flowers or kill insects. It is published by Canongate and is the ideal gift for Christmas for an elderly person living alone.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>More infos :&nbsp; <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/melodic-records/08-story-time\">https://soundcloud.com/melodic-records/08-story-time</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>HOLY FAMILY</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.melodic.co.uk/word/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/COVERART-315x315.jpg\" style=\"height:315px; width:315px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>As anyone who&rsquo;s ever stayed in one place far too long will know, sometimes a drastic change is what&rsquo;s needed. For Holy Family, the duo of non-blood brothers Anton Ekman and Viktor Hansson, a radical relocation from Sweden to Canada has helped shape the sound of their transatlantic debut album Can&rsquo;t Dance, Wont Steal, Need Some Help.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The last months before moving to Montreal, living in Gothenburg had become increasingly unbearable,&rdquo; recalls Ekman. &ldquo;To us, Gothenburg was the city that we&rsquo;d initially adopted as our home and it&rsquo;s accepting us was a big deal. But inevitably we started dragging our feet behind us and needed a change of pace.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Country kids at heart, Montreal&rsquo;s lush scenery provided respite from the daily rigmarole of their home city with Canada&rsquo;s open spaces having a far bigger influence on the pair than they expected. The expedition wasn&rsquo;t a case of simply &lsquo;finding&rsquo; themselves, this was a band who had already met, gotten to know each other, performed at Toronto Film Festival, received an award from the Swedish Association of Composers (STIM), and broken up with themselves; originally a trio until their third member left town, if anyone could be certain of their identity, it&rsquo;s Holy Family. &ldquo;As a trio we struggled to make long-distance work but after a while we had to accept that sending files back and forth between each other wasn&rsquo;t for us,&rdquo; admits Hansson. &ldquo;Our sole goal was to make enough tracks to fund inter-rail tickets for an Eastern European tour. Somewhere down the line we stopped dreaming of Eastern Europe but continued making tracks.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ironically, going the distance was precisely what the pair needed, and under their new guise as a duo they set course for Montreal having felt a kinship with Canadian exports Wolf Parade and Godspeed You! Black Emperor whilst needing to venture far enough away so that backing out wasn&rsquo;t an option. Whilst strolling around downtown on one of their first days in the city, the pair passed a homeless man with sign that said &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t dance, won&rsquo;t steal, need some help&rdquo;. &ldquo;It stuck with us. Possibly because it did feel like we needed a whole lot of help being in a new town without any real safety nets,&rdquo; they remember.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Superbly demonstrating Holy Family&rsquo;s uniquely ambivalent sense of place, five of Can&rsquo;t Dance&rsquo;s tracks were completed in Montreal with the other five completed back in Gothenburg. The sound of two worlds colliding, it&rsquo;s a culmination of where the duo is headed and where they&rsquo;ve already been. Written whilst sharing the one-bedroom Montreal apartment where the band currently resides, &lsquo;East Coast Nerves&rsquo; resurfaces the mechanical rhythms heard by Viktor in a previous life as a Gothenburg dock-worker, whilst home-grown track &lsquo;Youth Cult&rsquo;s stripped back mood looks towards the pair&rsquo;s future in their new location. The fuzz ripping through the doom laden garage sound of Gothenburg track &lsquo;Keeping Up&rsquo; recalls the city&rsquo;s unquenchable thirst for romanticising the industrial working class days and it&rsquo;s brilliantly offset against the uplifting atmospherics of Montreal track &lsquo;Trail Of Songs&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;To be able to have the perspectives of both being inside looking out and outside looking in was important,&rdquo; they say. &ldquo;The first couple of months after moving to Montreal we hadn&rsquo;t really started working so inevitably a lot of time was spent reflecting on how our lives had been previously and trying to figure out how we wanted them to be.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether finding a way to mix things up a little or simply as a means of escape Can&rsquo;t Dance is an album fuelled by hope. From questioning the status quo and social roles of a previous life to focusing upon wants and needs mostly born out of personal frustrations for now, Holy Family&rsquo;s distinct approach comes from appreciation rather than disdain; from hoping that life will prove itself somewhat moldable, wherever they find themselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3Ams5iunimw\" width=\"854\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>More infos : <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/holyfamilyholyfamily/\">https://www.facebook.com/holyfamilyholyfamily/</a></div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

It&#39;s roster is certainly a testament to this fact - the likes of Lali Puna, M&uacute;m, Isan, Seabear, Sin Fang, S&oacute;ley, It&acute;s A Musical, Masha Qrella, Tarwater, Fm Belfast, Pascal Pinon, Butcher The Bar, Telekinesis, Opiate, Ms. John Soda, Tied &amp; Tickled Trio, Electric President, Radical Face, The Go Find, and B.Fleischmann making for an impeccable roster. With more than 100 Albums in its catalogue, Morr Music is a label that truly has something for everyone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Interview with Thomas Morr boss of the label Morr Music</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"115\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://www.euradionantes.eu/embed/podcast/10331\" style=\"overflow: hidden;\" width=\"100%\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.morrmusic.com/\">https://www.morrmusic.com/</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/morrmusicberlin/\">https://www.facebook.com/morrmusicberlin/</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/morrmusic\">https://soundcloud.com/morrmusic</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>THE ARTISTS / RECORDS</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>PASCAL PINON</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://api.morrmusic.com/image/1bbcc6ce-0ffb-4024-ab88-17ac5e260196/260.jpg\" style=\"height:260px; width:260px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pascal Pinon&#39;s third album is the Icelandic duo&#39;s rawest and yet most diverse musical statement within the frame of their Folk-influenced, minimalistic sound. Produced only by themselves, &quot;Sundur&quot; comprises material written over the course of 1 &frac12; years. While most parts of the album are sparsely orchestrated and follow the experimental lo-fi-leaning aesthetics of the duo&#39;s previous two records, the overall tone has become rawer with its metronome-like rhythms, occasional synth lines and driving piano melodies.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Sundur&quot; lends its title from the Icelandic proverb &quot;sundur og saman&quot; (meaning &quot;apart and together&quot;) and could be considered the companion of 2013&#39;s &quot;Twosomeness&quot;. Thematically, it reflects upon the voluntary separation of the two sisters. &quot;We&nbsp;had&nbsp;never been apart our entire lives until&nbsp;we finished&nbsp;touring with our last album&quot;, remembers J&oacute;fr&iacute;&eth;ur &Aacute;kad&oacute;ttir. While &Aacute;sthildur went to Amsterdam to study classical piano and composition and back to Iceland, her sister J&oacute;fr&iacute;&eth;ur went to tour the world with her other band, Samaris, and still leads a nomadic lifestyle.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBeing apart is not only the main thematic thread running through &quot;Sundur&quot;, it also turned Pascal Pinon&#39;s writing process upside down. Although &Aacute;sthildur and J&oacute;fr&iacute;&eth;ur frequently visited each other in the Netherlands and respectively Iceland from&nbsp;early 2014&nbsp;until late 2015 to finish the writing process, the geographical separation also influenced their compositions and thus the album as a whole. &quot;The fact&nbsp;that&nbsp;we spent so much time apart creates completely different connections between the songs than on &#39;Twosomeness&#39;, which for me makes it more diverse in the best way possible&quot;, says &Aacute;sthildur in regards to the LP&#39;s predecessor. Indeed &quot;Sundur&quot; sees two different people arriving at their shared creative goal.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDue to a conflict of schedules, &Aacute;sthildur and J&oacute;fr&iacute;&eth;ur ended up recording the bulk of &quot;Sundur&quot; in only two days. Their father, composer &Aacute;ki &Aacute;sgeirsson, helped out with the engineering and contributed percussions played with scrap metal he brought with him, including discarded parts of airplanes. While few of those details will be audible on the surface, the unpolished sound design and added bits are crucial to &quot;Sundur&quot;, the result of an intense musical collaboration between the three family members. &quot;It makes the album feel more real and raw which is what it essentially is all about,&quot; explains J&oacute;fr&iacute;&eth;ur. &quot;It&#39;s very sparse and a lot closer in the approach and in regards to the sound of our very first album. It&#39;s kind of funny that seven years later, we would go back to the same place where we were at age 14!&quot; Here they are however, with a record which is as intimate as it is mature.</p>\r\n\r\n<div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jSNTHQs9_W0\" width=\"560\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>More infos : <a href=\"http://pascalpinon.com/\">http://pascalpinon.com/</a></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div><strong>SIN FANG</strong></div>\r\n\r\n<div><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://api.morrmusic.com/image/4a6fa466-8e5d-4014-ad52-833c0042cca4/260.jpg\" style=\"height:260px; width:260px\" /></strong></div>\r\n\r\n<div>Leaving the rooted flora of his previous album(s) behind, Sin Fang glides into uncharted territory with his fourth full-length entitled &quot;Spaceland&quot; &ndash; a collection of electrified tunes that pack a soft punch and some invisible bling. It&#39;s his idiosyncratic take on future r&amp;b, one that doesn&#39;t mince matters and features various guests including J&oacute;nsi, S&oacute;ley, Pascal Pinon&#39;s J&oacute;fr&iacute;&eth;ur &Aacute;kad&oacute;ttir and Farao.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA deeply personal and 100% contemporary take on electronic pop, &quot;Spaceland&quot; is more Southern Fried than Tropic of Cancer: Recorded between L.A. and Reykjav&iacute;k, it&#39;s an album that feels like diary entries spelled out like Billboard news headlines.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut it&#39;s also a self-therapy made strangely infectious thanks to entirely new production means: Dark lyrics over electrified euphoria, personal confessions set to sizzling hi-hats and heavy bass action. &quot;I wrote most of the lyrics after I started having panic attacks,&quot; he explains, adding that the album title actually refers to the headspace he was in during that period when he felt like he &quot;was dying all the time&quot;.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMostly written on the piano, entirely self-recorded and self-produced (with support from J&oacute;nsi &amp; Alex), Sin Fang thus ventures further into the direction he took with his new project Gangly and unleashes something both banging and feather-light &ndash; a combination he already presents in dreamlike album opener &quot;Candyland&quot;. The same kind of push-and-pull, the same r&amp;b-paced phrasings, a similar kind of juxtaposition is at work in &quot;Not Ready For Your Love&quot;, a line Sindri repeats over and over, all sweet-voiced surrender set to uplifting arrangements and synthetic fields of bliss.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA tale of non-belonging, &quot;Lost Girl&quot; oscillates between minimalism and experimentalism, magma-paced introspection and sonic sunlight that belies the darkness, when Sindri jumps to the dance-floor. As for the vocal harmonies of &quot;I Want You To Know&quot;: That&#39;s classic Sin Fang meets goose bumps like &quot;Cry Me A River&quot;. Former Seabear band-mate S&oacute;ley is at his side for another slice of epic (anti migraine) pop (&quot;Never Let Me Go&quot;), while Norwegian singer Farao is another female sidekick in the land of loops and swathes: Drawing a face in the melting snow for &quot;Please Don&#39;t&quot;, he picks up the pace with a hubbub of voices over a glacier-like arrangement. Towards the end, there&#39;s more playful beats (&quot;Branches&quot;), more open space (&quot;Snowblind&quot;), and finally, a homecoming of sorts: Slow moving album closer &quot;Down&quot; feat JFDR (that&#39;s J&oacute;fr&iacute;&eth;ur &Aacute;kad&oacute;ttir) sounds like rays of hope rediscovered.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDrifting too far away from the sun, it can get mighty cold out (and in) there, gloomy and cold, and yet that free-floating state of zero gravity can also lead to entirely new places. Sin Fang was there &ndash; and now he&#39;s back with &quot;Spaceland&quot;.</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"267\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/IRwApXP0mTM\" width=\"476\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>More infos : <a href=\"http://www.heysinfang.com/\">http://www.heysinfang.com/</a></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div><strong>SLOW STEVE</strong></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://api.morrmusic.com/image/0ec65201-e18a-47d7-a0cb-108c20aad3ef/260.jpg\" style=\"height:260px; width:260px\" /></strong></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>English For Everyone interview Remi Letournelle, the creative force behind a brand new band called <a href=\"http://slowsteveamour.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Slow Steve</a>!</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"115\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://www.euradionantes.eu/embed/podcast/10880\" style=\"overflow: hidden;\" width=\"100%\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>Are you ready for a bewitching pop adventure? Morr Music is releasing Slow Steve&#39;s Adventures, the debut album by Ex-Fenster member R&eacute;mi Letournelle. Following a 7&quot; split single on Berlin DIY label Sp&auml;ti Palace and Steps, a six-track EP released on Morr Music last year, Adventures is the first LP of the French man. His bubbling vintage synths (together with an impressive variety of instruments) will take you on a strange trip through imagined galaxies and secret deep-sea worlds. Call it weird, but this is amateur pop in all its glory, and the most natural outlet for Slow Steve. Think of Ariel Pink, John Maus, early Future Islands, old Krautrock luminaries or Arthur Russell - a whole school of alternative pop music that R&eacute;mi is very likely to join. Adventures is more than just an application.</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p><br />\r\nIn January 2015, he started working on the eleven songs that make up the album. While the Steps-EP was mainly jams R&eacute;mi created in his room with a bit of pot, whiskey, Casios and a TR707, he got deeper into songwriting for his first LP. The songs were recorded with producer Tadklimp for 5 days in the Worm Studio in Rotterdam, using their many glorious vintage synthesizers, and in Tadklimp&#39;s studio in Berlin. Apart from Charley Vecten, who started Slow Steve with R&eacute;mi as a live duo back in 2012, most of the instrument parts on the record were written and performed by R&eacute;mi himself.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen R&eacute;mi moved to Berlin, he met psychedelic pop outfit and fellow Morr signees Fenster. R&eacute;mi has been part of their live shows as well as contributing to their first two albums. There are certain familiarities between the washed-out sound of Fenster and Slow Steve, but Adventures sees R&eacute;mi doing his own thing. He says &quot;I had weird science fiction in mind, visions of Jules Verne drawings from the early 20th century and science fiction/action movies from the end of that same century. That&rsquo;s why it&#39;s called Adventures: I&rsquo;m picturing a kind of Indiana Jones going down to the bottom of the sea, to Lilliput and other crazy, weird worlds.&quot; Song titles like &quot;The Giant Spider Crab From Japan&quot; literally imply that this is a cosmic synth dive into creepy depths, while in &quot;Jos&eacute;phine II (Rivi&egrave;re)&quot; R&eacute;mi sends his two teenage nieces through the universe in some cute spacecraft. Elsewhere, you hear the inspiration that 70&#39;s French sci-fi movies and their experimental electronic scores had on R&eacute;mi, for instance in the blissful nostalgia reverberating in &quot;Oscillation&quot;. Even the sunshiny guitar pop and blurred synths of &quot;Sloth&quot; or &quot;Bali&quot; sooner or later end up in humorous excursions. All song structures seem to follow some secret rules - challenging but always easygoing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAdventures does what it says on the sleeve: surprise and mesmerize, somewhat wild and spaced out. Welcome to the curious world of Slow Steve.</p>\r\n\r\n<div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"267\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/A1dxl_D2ju0\" width=\"476\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>More infos : <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/slowslowsteve/\">https://www.facebook.com/slowslowsteve/</a></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div><strong>MASHA QRELLA</strong></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://api.morrmusic.com/image/93e66609-1a59-4f00-a72a-717467272a9e/260.jpg\" style=\"height:260px; width:260px\" /></strong></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>Her new album &quot;Keys&quot; shows Berlin-based musician Masha Qrella elegantly fusing disco-pop and songwriting. Written and produced by Qrella in her studio within one year, the album&rsquo;s eleven songs feature well-known elements of fragility, perfection and understatement, while walking a fine line between laconic coolness and passionate uptempo melancholia.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere is a new straightforwardness&nbsp;in how Qrella sings about break-ups, new beginnings, rescue pills and keys: &quot;Please don&rsquo;t give me your keys / cause I don&rsquo;t wanna have to give them back again,&quot; goes the refrain of the title track, whose deliberately sparse instrumentation is unexpectedly interrupted by the noise of traffic and construction sites. It&rsquo;s one of those little irritating and surprising twists that have always been crucial to Qrella&#39;s music.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile her earlier solo records relied on more electronic elements, stumbling beats and sonic textures, Masha Qrella now puts emphasis on her voice and songwriting. Finally, every sort of shyness seems to have vanished.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Every night another day, every day another night, every street leads to a new place than the one I used to find.&quot; This is the opening line of the album, and you&nbsp;get the feeling that Masha Qrella is breaking new personal ground on this record, which marks her fourth full length for Morr Music. Every single song on &quot;Keys&quot; shows an immediate and open-hearted quality that Qrella did not quite reveal before.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith this record, Masha Qrella creates a very distinct version of pop music, subtly reminding you of her love for Elliott Smith, Neil Young, Air or Metronomy, but always staying true to herself. Join her on this emotional dance floor.</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/bBhl7gBzBio\" width=\"854\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>More infos : <a href=\"http://mashaqrella.de\">http://mashaqrella.de</a></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div><strong>MS JOHN SODA</strong></div>\r\n\r\n<div><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://api.morrmusic.com/image/e2227061-04fb-48f6-a07c-b20505ebe39f/260.jpg\" style=\"height:260px; width:260px\" /></strong></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>Something is looming on the horizon, a flickering presence, a sparkle in the twilight, hardly visible at first, then slowly taking shape and finally coming into view: &quot;I will depart/I see, I will, I won&#39;t go far,&quot; Stefanie Boehm (Couch) sings on &quot;Sirens&quot;, one of 10 tracks Ms. John Soda have recorded for &quot;Loom&quot;, their first album in eight years &ndash; and it&#39;s true: It&#39;s a return that often feels like yet another departure, like it&#39;s time to say farewell once again, one last hug and off it goes into the valley, where life is already waiting.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA lot has changed since Ms. John Soda released the first 7&quot; back in 1998, since Micha Acher (The Notwist, Tied &amp; Tickled Trio, Alien Ensemble) joined Stefanie Boehm and completed the creative nucleus of this band around the turn of the millennium; day-to-day life indeed feels different some 16 years later (and half as many since the release of their sophomore album, &quot;Notes and the Like&quot;), but the basic chemistry, the intricate balance of electronic and analog molecules that orbit this nucleus &ndash; and thus, the resulting mood and vibe -, they&#39;re still recognizable, still undeniably Ms. John Soda: Whether it&#39;s the dense, intensely rushing soundscapes of &quot;Hero Whales&quot;, numerous layers pushing and taking off into the same direction, the propelled clatter of &quot;Sirens&quot;, a track like &quot;Millions&quot; that blows off more and more steam, a glistening, wheezing sort of madness even (though there is a tender side to it as well), the perpetual, magic lantern-like motions of &quot;Name It&quot; (think Trish Keenan and Broadcast) or the gradually descending melodies of opening track &quot;In My Arms&quot; &ndash; they&#39;re all lined with a certain tension, underpinned by a certain atmosphere, a unique brand of melancholy that never quite gives in, keeps searching for new outlets and answers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe album title Ms. John Soda have chosen for their third full-length, &quot;Loom&quot;, obviously hints at this feeling of re-emergence, gathering and looming, but according to the singer, it also refers to a weaving loom: It&#39;s about &quot;weaving and combining a vast number of influences, ideas, instruments, melodies, rhythms, and layers to create a whole,&quot; says Boehm, whose vocals span these new tracks like thick, reliable ropes that glow with marine luminescence. &quot;It&#39;s about weaving individuals into a group (&#39;Millions&#39;), weaving and merging former ideals and hopes with reality (&#39;The Light&#39;), combining &#39;hi&#39; and &#39;bye&#39;, beginning and end (&#39;Hi Fool&#39;), interweaving opposite or contradicting concepts, such as pushing forward vs. being pushed (&#39;In My Arms&#39;).&quot; And while the weaving, just like life itself, can easily get out of hands, &quot;because you lose track, and yet life goes on (&#39;Name It&#39;),&quot; a lot of these songs &ndash; e.g. &quot;Hero Whales&quot;, the billowing &quot;Sodawaltz&quot;, &quot;Fall Away&quot; &ndash; revolve around a shimmering sense of something we can&#39;t quite grasp or put a finger on just yet: &quot;Intuitions, hopes, dreams, wishes, affinities, distances, temptations&hellip;&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhereas Cico Beck aka Joasihno (drums, electronics), also part of Aloa Input and the latest addition to Ms. John Soda&#39;s live band, and drummer Thomas Geltinger helped out on various tracks they recorded with Oliver Z&uuml;lch in Weilheim, Boehm and Acher were also joined by Karl-Ivar Refseth (percussions) and Matthias G&ouml;tz (trombone). Together, they keep feeding the loom with countless spools of yarn, until epic piano closer &quot;Fall Away&quot; seems to offer a temporary respite: &quot;find your way/take the dry suit off/for a night&quot;. Time to rest, to take a deep breath. Or is it already the first rays of dawn looming on the horizon?</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cY8WAnBQcU4\" width=\"854\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>More infos : <a href=\"http://www.msjohnsoda.de/\">http://www.msjohnsoda.de/</a></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div><strong>FENSTER</strong></div>\r\n\r\n<div><br />\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://api.morrmusic.com/image/af5f52a9-6eba-425a-a6a6-040e01ad502f/260.jpg\" style=\"height:258px; width:260px\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div><strong>Fenster talks to English for Everyone about Emocean</strong></div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"115\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://www.euradionantes.eu/embed/podcast/10320\" style=\"overflow: hidden;\" width=\"100%\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>The Album: Fenster&#39;s EMOCEAN is the soundtrack to an adventure sci-fi film created by and starring the band. The music is a swirling cosmos of richly varied&nbsp;post-psychedelia, transcending the boundaries of reality and traditional pop-records to join the ranks of other genre bending Music Films like Daft Punk&#39;s &quot;Interstella 5555&quot; or Prince Rama&#39;s &quot;Never Forever&quot;.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith EMOCEAN, the band utilizes their classic approach to non-traditional percussion and instrumentation, but this time ventures deeper into new territory with funky bass lines (Off The Cahin) complimented by additional instruments like bass clarinet (Memories), flute (Phantasia) and modular synthesizers (Samson&#39;s Theme).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEMOCEAN is a nuanced and surprising departure from their first two albums. The approach to this record was a more holistic exercise in &quot;collective songwriting&quot; and was resulted from a series of feverish jam sessions. The sounds evoke a broad spectrum of parallel universes - from soothing surfy tidal cliffs to analog synth dungeons, interstellar purple-funk disco-techs, wobbly organ&#39;s in houses of worship, acid blues parades and delicate maiden&#39;s picking daisies on the moon (Les Fleurs).&nbsp;The most danceable track is definitely Off the Cahin, and Memories is a sun soaked summer jam.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Film: The film starts out as a documentary about the band struggling to finish their third record and they accidentally get transported into an alternate dimension in which they are deprived of feelings. In the surreal landscape of this foreign dimension, nothing is what it seems.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEMOCEAN&nbsp;was conceived as a conceptual soundtrack before the film&#39;s actual production and evolved into the most ambitious project the band has ever done. With a year of planning, over a month of shooting on HD and mostly VHS, a cast of over a 100 actors and extras, numerous outdoor and indoor locations, the rental of an entire island for a day, drone cameras and a self-built green screen studio, the project is unlike anything you&#39;ve ever seen and has brought the band to the edge of madness and what they thought was humanly possible.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Band: Based in Berlin and hailing from four different countries, FENSTER began as a collaboration between Jonathan Jarzyna (DE/PL) and JJ Weihl (US) in 2010 and was later completed by Lucas UFO (FR) and Will Samson (UK). The band has released two full-length records on Morr Music (Bones 2012 and The Pink Caves 2014) to critical acclaim and has toured extensively in the USA, UK and 15 other countries in Europe.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe band intends to tour with the film and play the soundtrack live, transforming the experience of classic silent cinema into a fantastical journey headed for the unknown.</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xD7bCGo8YyY\" width=\"420\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>More infos : <a href=\"http://www.fensterfensterfenster.com\">http://www.fensterfensterfenster.com</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>SOLEY</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://api.morrmusic.com/image/5804024a-c2b6-4d07-af74-445daaf64530/260.jpg\" style=\"height:260px; width:260px\" /></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Referring to the silence that returns when last year&#39;s &quot;Kr&oacute;mant&iacute;k&quot; EP fades out, S&oacute;ley said, &quot;&hellip; your closed eyes slowly start seeing something much deeper and darker,&quot; and now that something is here, it&#39;s right in front of us: &quot;Ask The Deep&quot; is a stunningly dark and deeply personal departure after the minimalist and bleak piano compositions of said EP: Relying on guts, ghost ships, and a sonic map that doesn&#39;t show the same piano coordinates as before, her soft-sounding voice leads us deeper and deeper into the shadowy fairytale worlds only hinted at on previous releases such as her &quot;Theater Island&quot; EP and 2011&#39;s much-praised &quot;We Sink&quot; debut album. Changing tactics to fight her inner demon with every track, &quot;Ask The Deep&quot; sees the bespectacled songwriter open Pandora&#39;s box &ndash; and close it eventually. At least for now.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Have I danced with the devil?&quot;, S&oacute;ley Stef&aacute;nsd&oacute;ttir asks on album opener &quot;Devil&quot;, then crescendoing: &quot;Does he still love me?&quot; And that inner demon, responsible for all the sunless spots, the moist corners where silky mosses grow, he&#39;s frequently beguiling her throughout &quot;Ask The Deep&quot;, even spinning and dancing, since he&#39;s hardly alone: Once the melodic surges of &quot;Devil&quot; lead to other fairytale soundscapes &ndash; the piano no longer being &quot;the main character&quot; of S&oacute;ley&#39;s music &ndash;, more and more ghosts, both real and imaginary, enter the scene. Inspired by an actual news story about a man who was buried alive in Brazil, &quot;&AElig;vint&yacute;r&quot; marches in circles with tribal beats underneath ethereal swirls, and &quot;One Eyed Lady&quot; is perhaps S&oacute;ley&#39;s most minimalist lullaby yet: It&#39;s the beatless account of a one-eyed witch that would actually &quot;kill for love&quot;, as the song&#39;s mantra reverberates into the void. Back in fairyland, a group of girls appears as nightmares in &quot;Halloween&quot;, sailing on a ghost ship, ambushing the boys, the dreamers of this disembodied, infernal dream built on layers of beats: &quot;Tell me how can I wake up again.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith looped forces of gravity and swerving nods to Philip Glass, &quot;Follow Me Down&quot; is a brooding roll call to enter the distorted depths, to go beyond the point of no return, to leave the comfort zone. And it&#39;s a reminder: We still sink. Amid the flotsam and jetsam, things appear that weren&#39;t previously there &ndash; hard-hitting drums set to Beach House vibes (&quot;Dreamers&quot;), a haunted church showdown with the jilted devil (&quot;I Will Never&quot;), a hint of unlikely, hopeful pop even (&quot;Breath&quot;) &ndash; until the inner demon reappears once again: Built around a part of the &quot;Devil&quot;, album closer &quot;Lost Ship&quot; deals with the same conflict, &quot;my devil, my master, my mind and my soul.&quot; &quot;It&#39;s saying I&#39;m stronger than my devil mind, though sometimes it wants to take over everything,&quot; she explains. Her final words on the album: &quot;&hellip; and do not forget/I never loved you&quot;.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt&#39;s funny, but with S&oacute;ley&#39;s music, metaphor is never just metaphor: When the multi-instrumentalist from Iceland sang &quot;I run away from you&quot; on her debut album, you could actually see her running through some forest (or some barren Icelandic field), and this capability to create a sense of situation, a surreal, dreamlike scenario via sound, it&#39;s still her trademark &ndash; albeit crowed by way more ghosts and Beelzebubian shadows this time around: Taking her listeners on a journey to phantasmal grounds, her sophomore full-length is both more intricate and diverse in how it&#39;s written, arranged and narrated. And it&#39;s even more obvious that her voice is crucial in guiding the way to that place where one can live, that safe shore on the other side of the ocean.<br />\r\n&quot;You must face your fairytale,&quot; the former student of composition sings elsewhere on &quot;Ask The Deep&quot;. She doesn&#39;t run. Faces him again and again. And even Willy Wonka would agree: She is the music maker &ndash; but we are the dreamers of the dreams.</p>\r\n\r\n<div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"267\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dDT1oigwvS0\" width=\"476\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>More infos : <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/soleysoleysoley/\">https://www.facebook.com/soleysoleysoley/</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>ALOA INPUT</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://api.morrmusic.com/image/18851eba-7356-4b7c-aca9-1064af4147c2/260.jpg\" style=\"height:260px; width:260px\" /></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whereas last time around, they were all about &quot;vocal harmonies from NYC to Cape Town&quot; and &quot;massive guitars from Portland to D&uuml;sseldorf, mixed with clattering beats from Berlin to Detroit&quot; Aloa Input &ndash; a Munich-based three-piece that seems to be just as addicted to new input as it&#39;s quick and productive when it comes to releasing more genre-smashing, ebullient output &ndash; are about to leave planet earth altogether with their sophomore release: Dropping only a year after the band&#39;s debut album &quot;Anysome&quot; (with additional remix EP &quot;RMX&quot; released in-between), they return with an album that finds them dashing through the better part of recent music history, to eventually take off for the Red Planet: &quot;MARS ETC.&quot; is terrestrial life condensed, an experimental study in hands-on, sonic set theory, both a stunningly wild and unbridled beast of an album and a long-overdue update to 1977&#39;s Voyager Golden Records.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile &quot;Anysome&quot; was recorded in cold Berlin during wintertime, the explosive and iridescent remains that constitute &quot;MARS ETC.&quot; were recorded on an island in Croatia &ndash; one that bears the almost Martian-sounding name Krk &ndash;, where Florian Kreier (aka Angela Aux, vocals/bass), Cico Beck (aka Joasihno, live member of Ms. John Soda and The Notwist; electronics/drums), and Marcus Grassl (guitars/vocals) turned a lighthouse into a temporary studio: A perfect spot to launch themselves and their increasingly cosmic network of influences (comprised of Art and World Music, Indie, Kraut, HipHop, Folk, etc.) into outer space.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter renowned production heavyweight Olaf Opal had seen them opening for The Notwist, he immediately reached out to Aloa Input, who happily accepted his offer to eventually co-produce and mix the Krk recordings in The Notwist&#39;s own studio in Weilheim. The resulting full-length, &quot;MARS ETC.&quot;, indeed feels like audio fireworks from the get-go, repeatedly indulging in the title&#39;s &quot;ETC.&quot; and sounding like a retrospective survey sans nostalgia and restless departure at once: Opening track &quot;Far Away Sun&quot; &ndash; all kiddie samples vs. insane, Jel-influenced beats &ndash; was actually recorded right before Aloa Input folded their tents in the lighthouse, and while &quot;Perry&quot; nods enthusiastically to Mr. Beck Hansen, the inscrutable &quot;Vampire&quot;, based on a Pocket Piano melody, seems to go for a last round on deserted roads (think Jarmusch&#39;s latest movie). Elsewhere, there&#39;s political statements in disguise (&quot;Brother&quot;), unhinged doors that swing and float in empty space (&quot;The Door&quot;), until the three-piece even manages to escape the influence of &quot;highway designers&quot; by emulating Hymie&#39;s Basement&#39;s similarly titled pop hymn with their own &quot;21st Century Tale&quot;, &quot;probably the most wide-eyed Aloa track of all time&quot;: A rather mellow confession of a maniac at first, until it drowns in a madcap collage of Disney soundscapes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Hold On&quot; is &ndash; like the entire album &ndash; a bit rougher around the edges, &quot;more beat-driven, playful, expansive and deeper&quot; at once, a tribute to Hunter S. Thompson that flickers like old, beaten VHS tapes, whereas indie anthem &quot;BlaBla Theory&quot; is banging enough to even send school kids off in a frenzy. Overjoyed to finally escape the forces of gravity, they first have to overcome a feeling known as &quot;Krk Blues&quot;: a softly pounding ode to life in this wonderful lighthouse. After that, it&#39;s time to pack a few all-time favorites (Beck, Flaming Lips, Beatles, Eels, Dylan, Beach Boys) in a single track (&quot;Mad As Hell&quot;), until all we&#39;re left with is &quot;Ruth The Communist&quot;: A misunderstanding, now turned into the hologram of a femme fatale, and then: &quot;The record takes off towards the sun, takes a quick look back, waves good-bye, and that&#39;s it.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo a spectator, shades and field glass at the ready, it would have looked like this: There&#39;s a humming sound inside the rocket-like vehicle, the countdown&#39;s over, flames start shooting up, and there&#39;s smoke as well &ndash; but luckily, Aloa Input managed to keep that keyboard-charring cable fire in check as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"267\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/AQrZgYePnjs\" width=\"476\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>More infos : <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/aloainput/\">https://www.facebook.com/aloainput/</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>THE DODOS</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://api.morrmusic.com/image/bf0f7505-39c0-493d-a009-dd35c055a96a/260.jpg\" style=\"height:260px; width:260px\" /></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the Dodos &quot;the best time to make a record is right after you&#39;ve finished one&quot; says vocalist and guitarist Meric Long. Having just wrapped up the sessions for Carrier, and fired up on the level of comfort achieved with brothers Jay and Ian Pellicci at Tiny Telephone studio, the duo immediately began laying to tape the batch of songs that would make up Individ.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;The songs came together easily, there was not a lot questioning, just moving ahead with the feeling that we were on the right track. We were freed up to do whatever came naturally,&quot; says Long. And what comes naturally to the Dodos is creating music that sounds positively epic.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;In a lot of ways making this record brought us back to making Visiter,&quot; their 2008 critical and commercial breakthrough, &quot;relying heavily on the movement that occurs between just two instruments, guitar and drums. From the first take of the first song we tracked, things sounded huge and that set the tone for the entire thing.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIndivid&#39;s first single &quot;Competition&quot; is a shining example of this proclivity, built on dueling guitar lines that overlap above and below a persistent drum beat as Long&rsquo;s assured vocals soar above it all.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs the album closes with &quot;Pattern/Shadow&quot; (a track that features vocals from Thee Oh Sees&#39; Brigid Dawson), Long sings &quot;Your shadow remains / I cannot resist / The mirrored escape / Of your pattern.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt&#39;s a moment that lyrically reinforces the record&#39;s guiding force of acceptance, imparting a lesson to a band whose name inherently calls into question its future: resilience isn&#39;t always about changing or adapting to a new environment, sometimes it&#39;s about staying true to your instincts and asserting yourself in this ever changing atmosphere.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nExplains Long, &quot;Carrier was about breaking habits, recognizing and imagining yourself away from the washing machine that has you trapped. That&#39;s why the cover image was of someone watching a tornado go away from him. This record is about accepting what is natural for you or maybe even a part of you. Individ is what it sounds like inside the tornado.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"405\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PExmJwKHbVc\" width=\"650\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>More infos : <a href=\"http://www.dodosmusic.net\">http://www.dodosmusic.net</a></p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

The name comes from the &bdquo;K&ouml;ln-Kalk&ldquo; district where the label started out. Over the past 17 years the label has amounted a superb catalog totaling well over 60 releases by a dazzling array of artists spanning the broadest possible spectrum of musical output.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some of the most notable musicians to have released on Kalk include Scottish post-jazz pianist Bill Wells, To Rococo Rot bassist Mapstation aka Stefan Schneider, Static aka classically trained drummer Hanno Leichtmann, tireless musical activist Guido M&ouml;bius and the meister of prepared-piano Hauschka. Of all the acts to appear on KK, the later has undoubtedly reached the widest audience, with continued success and international acclaim, it was Kalk that first brought Hauschka&#39;s unique style to the world. While between them Bill Wells and Stefan Schneider have worked with everyone from Aidan Moffat and Barbara Morgenstern to Mahar Shalal Hash Baz and Hans-Joachim Roedelius.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, besides all these well known names Karaoke Kalk is very much about supporting new talent and bringing to light fantastic new artists who might not otherwise get a break. And so the label is proud to support young artists which recent releases by the likes of Donna Regina, Emanuele Errante, Dakota Suite, Toulouse Low Trax, Roman and J.R.Plankton goes to show.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2004 the label relocated from Cologne to Berlin where label head Thorsten L&uuml;tz aka DJ Strobocop is extremely active with residencies and regular appearances at some of the best clubs around town. The label is now firmly established as one of the finest the &bdquo;Musical Capital&ldquo; of Europe has to offer. A year later, Karaoke Kalk spawned the Kalk Pets sublabel again proving the Kalk&#39;s ongoing support of the clubscene with a focus on remix 12&ldquo;s. So far the sublabel has released over 20 vinyl Eps with contributions from the likes of DeWalta, Paul Frick (from Brandt, Brauer, Frick), Daniel Meteo, Atom TM and Chica Paula. Kalk Pets proves the labels undying love for the vinyl format and affinity with traditional djing and ever changing club landscape. Since 2006 the label has had its own publisher too - Karaoke Kalk Musikverlag &ndash; empowering its artists to retain control of their rights.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Karaoke Kalk release wonderful electronic and indie sounds beyond the cliches: label boss Thorsten L&uuml;tz likes to sit on the fence, creating his own niche for music beyond all the fleeting trends and typical media categorizations. It is one of the few genuinely eclectic labels out there, covering an astonishingly wide range of genres encompassing everything from ambient and indie to electronic, experimental and singer-songwriter. It&#39;s one of the true joys of Karaoke Kalk that one just never knows that the label is going to release next: it could go in any direction. The fact is no matter what style of music the label selects, its always of the highest standard and never fails to surprise and delight with each new release.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Interview with Thorsten LUTZ head of karaoke kalk :</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"115\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://www.euradionantes.eu/embed/podcast/11138\" style=\"overflow: hidden;\" width=\"100%\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://karaokekalk.de/\">http://karaokekalk.de/</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/KaraokeKalk.official\">https://www.facebook.com/KaraokeKalk.official</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/karaoke-kalk\">https://soundcloud.com/karaoke-kalk</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>THE ARTISTS / RECORDS</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>DAKOTA SUITE</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://karaokekalk.de/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/KK-94-The-Sea-Is-Never-Full_450_450-300x300.jpg\" style=\"height:300px; width:300px\" /></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The origin of this collaboration began two months prior to the Fukushima disaster in Japan. Dakota Suite had been touring Japan with their friends from the Japanese band called &lsquo;Vampillia&rsquo; and had been in several coastal locations in Wakayama as well as places near to Fukushima. The tsunami was very upsetting for Chris Hooson and David Buxton from Dakota Suite who then set about making music to reflect this overwhelming sadness and loss for Japan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They approached Vampillia to work on these somber reflective songs for the sea. Vampillia is next alternative music from Osaka. Guitar, Noise guitar, Bass, Piano, Classical Strings, Velladon on Opera, Mongoloid on the dark metal vocals alongside twin drummers Talow the Tornado (NICE VIEW, TURTLE ISLAND) and Tatsuya Yoshida (RUINS).<br />\r\nFrom this lineup of 10 (sometimes more) comes experimental and beautiful dark music. Besides the new work with Dakota Suite, they have previously collaborated with acts such as &micro;-Ziq, Merzbow, Nadja and Lustmord. Their intense experimental style is the perfect fusion with the Dakota Suite aesthetic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The songs came from a desire to reflect the phases of the disaster, the rising violent seas, the destructive power and loss preceding sorrow at the devastation which followed. Chris Hooson was haunted by images of floating pieces of wood which had once been someone&rsquo;s ancient dwelling. The music Dakota Suite &amp; Vampillia have recorded on The Sea is Never Full seeks to provide a mechanism to deal with this pain cathartically.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Various short pieces were passed between Dakota Suite and vampillia, who added strings and the distinctive throat singing of &lsquo;mongoloid&rsquo; from vampillia. Japanese throat singing speaks to an ancient method, called rekukkara. It is tonal rather than melodic. As Hooson says &bdquo;It seemed an appropriate way to convey the sadness we felt at the horror of Fukushima, which knows no words to express it accurately.&ldquo;<br />\r\nAfter basic recording had been completed, David Buxton, in an act of pure genius, took apart every note of the music and created a two-part suite. It is hard to convey the seismic shift in this project after David presented this music in the form that it now stands. Hooson on his Dakota Suite band colleague Buxton &ldquo;It has been the highlight of my recording career so far and David would not like the attention I give him, but I believe that this work in particular deserves to be heard as it is a work of beautiful and tragic choreography, it is a tribute to his mastery of music.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This type of art cannot be written or envisaged, it can only be received and interpreted. Listening to this project continues to engender enormous sorrow in the listener, but the true beauty of such art is that it can take this sorrow as a cathartic force to help one manage these feelings. The Sea Is Never Full marks another momentous release for Karaoke Kalk. Together with Vampillia they have sculpted a truly epic record spanning musical styles from ambient and experimental to post-rock and neo-classical. Suffice to say, the result has nothing short if a breathtaking emotional impact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More infos : <a href=\"http://www.dakotasuite.com\">http://www.dakotasuite.com</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>QUENTIN SIRJACQ</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://karaokekalk.de/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Quentin_Sirjacq_450_450-300x300.jpg\" style=\"height:300px; width:300px\" /></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>With Far Islands And Near Places Parisian pianist, composer and multi-instrumentist Quentin Sirjacq releases his solo debut on Karoake Kalk. While he has collaborated with Dakota Suite on the 2014 release There Is A Calm To Be Done for instance, this is the first release under his own name for the Berlin label. The album expands on the sound signature and composition style that Sirjacq has been cultivating for some time through his releases on labels such as Ambiances Magn&eacute;tiques, Brocoli and the Japanese label Schole where he previously put out 3 albums. On Far Islands And Near Places he notably expands on the instrumentation of his previous album Piano Memories in order to extend the resonances of the piano as well as add a more rhythmic quality to it. The new album features a wide range of additional instruments such as fender rhodes, synthesizers, marimba, vibraphone and glockenspiel on top of the ever present piano as the central instrument. This allows Quentin to explore new possibilities and add extra layers of richness to the arrangements. The result is a truly diverse musical palette. While the core melodies are often still played on piano, as you might expect &ndash; this being the instrument Sirjacq studied at the Royal Conservatory in The Hague between 1999 and 2004 as well as music composition in Mills college USA between 2005 and 2006, there are moments of euphoric electronics such as on Bodies, which verges on a minimal club style. Other tracks on the album, Orange for example, adopt a more traditional approach. The album takes its title from the tune Far Islands, a subdued and haunting ballad centered around fender rhodes and completed with subtle percussion. As one might expect for someone who has worked with none other than the great Fred Frith, Sirjacq&rsquo;s compositions also lean towards experimentalism and avant-garde in places, as can be heard on the tunes Round Dance and Its Raining In My House which make such great use of the melodic percussion instruments; glockenspiel, vibraphone and marimbas. In his own words Quentin Sirjacq says &ldquo;I believe music today should allow us to care more about our inner life and self understanding in order to become more peaceful individuals and acknowledge the complexity and mystery of the human being.&rdquo; This is exactly what Far Islands And Near Places does. The final result is for the listener to be carried on a journey through different subconscious places, by using classical composition techniques from classical music, jazz or song writing in connection with today&rsquo;s way of hearing and producing music through new technologies. Such a beautiful record will no doubt appeal to fans of neo-classical, ambient and modern chamber music.</p>\r\n\r\n<div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"282\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PRk0fdqE0o0\" width=\"353\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>More infos : <a href=\"http://www.quentinsirjacq.com\">http://www.quentinsirjacq.com</a></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div><strong>ASTROBAL</strong></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://karaokekalk.de/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Astrobal_Australasie_450_450-300x300.jpg\" style=\"height:300px; width:300px\" /></strong></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Astrobal, nee Emmanuel Mario, burst onto the scene in his native France through collaborations with some of the country&rsquo;s most cutting edge artists, including Arnaud Fleurent-Didier, Holden, Institut, Hyperclean&hellip; Most notably, his work as a producer and drummer with Stereolab&rsquo;s Laetitia Sadier left an indelible mark, rendering some of the most singular work from the iconic French chanteuse.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Our blood runs hydrous with the seas/The essence of oceans spills through our veins.&rdquo; Laetitia Sadier matter-of-factly unfurls these words on the title track of Astrobal&rsquo;s first full-length, and they prove prescient. The album is aqueous, each track a slow wave building before a momentous crash of sound, with clean lines and fluid form. Symphonic strings and ethereal ambient washes are married to buzzing synths and Astrobal&rsquo;s crisp, crackling drums.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Take opening track &ldquo;Everybody Loves the Sunrise&rdquo;: building slowly from Eno-esque synth gauze and swelling strings, it gradually layers in flutes, ricocheting drum snaps, and rubbery bass, crescendoing in a lush wall of sound before returning to its calm, Sunday morning peacefulness. The funky flipside to this opening chill is the strutting cool of &ldquo;Isao &amp; IO.&rdquo; Floating in on a laidback, Shuggie-Otis-on-quaaludes groove, Astrobal&rsquo;s wispy, French-accented vocals glide through crackling keys and chopped acoustic guitar, creating a melodic haze to get lost in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though eclectic, Australasie never feels less than a cohesive vision, with the guiding principles of texture and fluidity uniting the disparate threads. From the lounge-y slink of &ldquo;Rubycon&rdquo; to the hymnal warmth of &ldquo;Trois Beaux Oiseaux du Paradis,&rdquo; Astrobal creates a universe one can swim around in; from start to finish, it is of a particular mood, all beholden to the vibe. It is an assured first full-length from an artist who has put in the time to find himself and build his own world.</p>\r\n\r\n<div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nEbMs2lNI5A\" width=\"854\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>More infos : <a href=\"http://www.astrobal.com/\">http://www.astrobal.com/</a></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div><strong>RITORNELL</strong></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://karaokekalk.de/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Cover_450_450-300x300.jpg\" style=\"height:300px; width:300px\" /></strong></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Could everything be different? What if, for example, nine was actually eight? Well then, &lsquo;If Nine Was Eight&rsquo; is the third studio album from Ritornell &ndash; following up from &lsquo;Golden Solitude&rsquo; (2009, Karaoke Kalk) and &lsquo;Aquarium Eyes&rsquo; (2013, Karaoke Kalk).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Naturally, nine stays nine, that is not going to change. Gently but firmly, Richard Eigner and Roman Gerold (both born in 1983) do it nonetheless: on &lsquo;If Nine Was Eight&rsquo; they create states of suspension and illusion, which not only blur the lines between pop and art but also between acoustic and electronic sounds. The ambiguous beauty of their music has been compared to a detailed botanical still life: you half expect to see movement among the leaves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Contrabass flute, cello, piano, Rhodes, these are only some of the ingredients that make up the ten tracks on &lsquo;If Nine Was Eight&rsquo;. On this album, percussionist Eigner and pianist Gerold collaborated again with a number of musicians: Jazz tubist Jon Sass, saxophonist Werner Zangerle, and Swiss avant-garde percussionist Julian Sartorius are among the contributors. Flip Philipp, member of the Wiener Symphoniker, plays marimba and vibraphone. Various flutes are added by Norbert Traw&ouml;ger, a prolific mediator between old and new music. Mira Lu Kovacs (Schmieds Puls) is responsible for the lyrics of and vocals on the track &lsquo;Old People,&rsquo; and Viennese artist Mimu Merz (Book of Now) is once more a part of the team. In addition, the soulful vocals on the track &lsquo;Sleeping Alone&rsquo; are courtesy of Tobias Koett of the duo Ant Antic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Ritornell&rsquo;s protean live performances everything is flexible. Depending on the context, Eigner and Gerold dress their compositions in different guises: dance tunes can morph into planar-cloudy soundscapes and vice versa. Thus they demonstrate that even if nine can never be eight, at least their music is full of possibilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"225\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZE-evNbOvt4\" width=\"400\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>More infos : <a href=\"http://ritornell.at\">http://ritornell.at</a></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div><strong>POST INDUSTRIAL BOYS</strong></div>\r\n\r\n<div><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://karaokekalk.de/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/KK_90_Post_Industrial_Boys_450_450-300x300.jpg\" style=\"height:300px; width:300px\" /></strong></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div><strong><strong><strong>Interview with George Dzodzuashvili from Post Industrial Boys by Austin Smith :</strong></strong></strong></div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"115\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://www.euradionantes.eu/embed/podcast/10516\" width=\"100%\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite the project name Post Industrial Boys is basically one man, George Dzodzuashvili aka Gogi. He&rsquo;s a musician from Tbilisi and is part of the Goslab artist collective together with TBA /Natalie Beridze and many more. So far Post Industrial Boys previously released two albums on Thomas Brinkmann&rsquo;s Max Ernst label. But with Unintended, Post Industrial Boys return with their first album in 10 years. And, we are delighted to say, for the first time on Karaoke Kalk. Unintended is an intimate and reflective collection of songs produced in a unique style &ndash; part pop, part electronica.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The album starts with the song &bdquo;Strange&ldquo; and there is without question a strangeness to the Post Industrial Boys sound throughout the album. But it&rsquo;s a strangeness that soon becomes as familiar as an old friend with repeated listens. A title like &bdquo;It&rsquo;s me&ldquo; makes it clear that the album is a very personal statement by Gogi. In his own words: &rdquo;although there is a big time difference between some of them, for me they are one whole, all reflecting important changes in my life.&rdquo; Indeed, most of the songs on the album were inspired by lyrics written by Gogi&rsquo;s wife, which reflect on the period of time in their lives when all these songs were written &ndash; from 2007 to 2013. So one could say the album is kind of a family diary.<br />\r\nThe only song with Georgian lyrics is &ldquo;Naked&rdquo;. The words are by the 19th century Georgian poet Vaja-Pshavela. This song is a collaboration with the actress and singer Mzia Arabuli, who comes from the mountain region and sings in the style of Georgian folk songs. In short, the lyrics say that we are born naked, don&rsquo;t really posses anything in life and die naked.<br />\r\n&ldquo;Passenger&rdquo; is a tale of transit and travel. It&rsquo;s intense use of repetitive melodies and vocoders conjure images of the monotony of everyday commuting. Other songs like &ldquo;Through&rdquo;, &ldquo;Sometimes&rdquo; and &ldquo;Raindrops&rdquo; make clever use of an ambient backdrop that creates a trance like mood while abstract melodies, beats and lyrics subtly criss-cross the audio field. While &ldquo;Directions&rdquo; is structured in the manner of a fairy tales: kind of like a choose your own adventure story in song format. Sinister melodies envelope the song creating a mysterious atmosphere.<br />\r\nThe album closes with its title track, a sweet little ballad comprising gently strummed acoustic guitar and lilting piano melodies. The lyrics are as open and heartfelt as throughout the rest of the album.&ldquo;I was in love but I never noticed it&rdquo; calls the refrain &ndash; a touching sentiment on which to close a truly remarkable record.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unintended is a perfect album for anyone into emotionally charged, inspiring left-field electronic pop. The 10 songs contained and the production used within them achieve the impressive feet of fusing the accessibility of pop melodies, lyrics and structures with an obscure and challenging sound design. Besides their precisely crafted production the songs on Unintended are characterized by the quaintly monotone delivery of George Dzodzuashvili&rsquo;s vocal performance &ndash; all the more expressive for the fact that many words are half spoken rather than sung. The lyrics are pensive with a marvelous daydreamy quality while at the same time still being rooted in everyday experience. It doesn&rsquo;t take long for the Post Industrial Boys sound to seep into your soul, and when it does you will cherish the songs on Unintended forever.</p>\r\n\r\n<div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"352\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nozBoxWbjkg?list=PLsHQjV3UD8G5kW7YdmVjB7p2LvdLgL6st\" width=\"470\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>More infos :&nbsp; <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Post-Industrial-Boys-459879697487944/\">https://www.facebook.com/Post-Industrial-Boys-459879697487944/</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>BILL WELLS &amp; FRIENDS</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://karaokekalk.de/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/KK_Bill_Wells__Friends_Nursery_Rhymes_450_450-300x300.jpg\" style=\"height:300px; width:300px\" /></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;If people thought it was a bit strange, then they didn&rsquo;t say,&rdquo; says Bill Wells of the stellar cast of collaborators who played and sung on his new album, Nursery Rhymes. &ldquo;I made it all clear pretty early on in proceedings and everyone seemed up for it.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, actually, it is a bit strange, but then think of Wells&rsquo; trademark combination of spare, melodic compositions with adventurous arrangements for the National Jazz Trio Of Scotland, particularly his adaptions of Christmas songs on their Christmas Album &ndash; and he&rsquo;s a perfect fit for the job. In fact, it works precisely because it&rsquo;s such an unusual undertaking, although the material provided common ground for the 18 musicians on the album. The songs are like musical archetypes embedded in the mind from the playground, but listening to the album you soon forget that context, as it reveals itself as a series of odd, cryptic and disquieting tunes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aby Vulliamy, vocalist with NJTOS, had suggested the idea to Wells, but he was initially unsure as to how it would work. &ldquo;No one&rsquo;s going to say that &lsquo;Humpty Dumpty&rsquo; or &lsquo;Three Blind Mice&rsquo; is one of their favourite tunes,&rdquo; he laughs. &ldquo;But if I could do something that made me like the end result, then it was justified.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After winning the inaugural Scottish Album Of The Year award for Everything&rsquo;s Getting Older, which he made with former Arab Strap vocalist Aidan Moffat in 2012, Wells secured some funding from Creative Scotland to go make an album in New York City with a musician he had long admired, Karen Mantler, the vocalist, multi-instrumentalist and band leader &ndash; and daughter of innovative jazz musicians Carla Bley and Mike Mantler.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wells made an initial visit in early 2014 to meet Mantler, find a recording studio and to start recruiting musicians. He was able to fund Aby to come over to sing and play viola on the album, but in the spirit of the commission decided that he would otherwise only record musicians who were in or around New York. Mantler suggested bringing in vocalists Syd Straw and Amy Allison, and Wells asked long time collaborator Norman Blake of Teenage Fanclub, now based in Canada, to produce the album. Vocalist Isobel Campbell happened, coincidentally, to be in the area at the time. He also invited Yo La Tengo, and Satomi Matsuzaki and Greg Saunier from Deerhoof, who play individually and collectively on a number of tracks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In August 2014 sessions began with Wells recording his piano parts to a click track to give a basic structure. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve learned from experience that it&rsquo;s often good to leave things fairly open,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Sometimes people will collaborate with other musicians and won&rsquo;t really let them do what they do best.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yo La Tengo&rsquo;s involvement was complicated by the fact that Wells arrived at guitarist Ira Kaplan and drummer Georgia Hubley&rsquo;s apartment with some demos that Kaplan was unable to open on his computer. &ldquo;I was talking about different styles and he looked a little concerned,&rdquo; Wells recalls. &ldquo;And then he said this, and it was such a great and appropriate line for any collaboration that it has stayed with me ever since: &lsquo;Please don&rsquo;t underestimate what we can&rsquo;t do&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As it turns out, they made a considerable contribution and Wells enthuses about every one of the musicians and singers who gave their own particular stamp to this collection of songs. He gives a special mention to legendary vocalist and composer Annette Peacock; violinist Charlie Burnham who has played with Cassandra Wilson and James Blood Ulmer; singer and Tony-winning actor Michael Cerveris; and Amber Papini from the band Hospitality. &ldquo;I was delighted that she was involved,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Someone new and of a different generation.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He was also pleased to get the participation of Bridget St John, the English singer/songwriter who has been a long time resident of New York. When Wells was initially working on &ldquo;Ding Dong Bell&rdquo;, he could hear her voice singing it in his mind. &ldquo;She sings it with conviction,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;And after she recorded it she said, &lsquo;That&rsquo;s the child who tortures animals and grows up to be a serial killer&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nursery Rhymes is a unique record in that it recasts these funny, violent, coded, centuries-old sentiments as fresh, new creations. Wells is a brilliant arranger and does wonders in finding new ways of looking at the songs, and drawing more out of their strong but spare melodic material. And he positively relishes the juxtaposition of a simple tune with dark lyrics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;They should be quite disturbing,&ldquo; he observes. &ldquo;Because ultimately part of the remit of a nursery rhyme was to give your child some of the harsh realties of life, while sugar-coating them with a catchy little melody. But I&rsquo;m losing that coating and going straight to the nub of the thing.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"264\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PTFOUw1uydw\" width=\"470\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>More infos :&nbsp; <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/NJTOS\">https://www.facebook.com/NJTOS</a></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div><strong>DIS COVER / DONNA REGINA</strong></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://karaokekalk.de/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Cover-25-years-Donna-Regina-22-300x300.jpg\" /></strong></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>In 1990 apartheid ended in South Africa and an election was held for a unified Germany for the first time since the Berlin Wall fell. That&rsquo;s a quarter of a century ago now and throughout all this time Donna Regina have made music. &bdquo;Avec le Temps&ldquo; appeared in 1990 and from then on Regina and G&uuml;nther Janssen have moved with the times, as musicians and as a married couple. So far they have written and recorded 12 albums worth of material. House music in the literal sense of the word as their music has almost always taken shape at Regina and G&uuml;nther&rsquo;s home. At first always in Cologne, in the mean time also in Berlin.<br />\r\nIn so doing they have managed a wondrous feet: to do their thing for 25 years without ever following any trends or succumbing to hype. But their music always sounded fresh, fitting to the times and remained recognizable. This no doubt has much to do with Regina Janssen&rsquo;s breathy voice and G&uuml;nther Janssen&rsquo;s light hand and his sense for the beauty of melodies. But there&rsquo;s something else to it. In 2007 the De:Bug magazine wrote &bdquo;In this music lies sovereignty, experience, truth and yes, even such important things as defiance and pride&ldquo;. That was a good observation at the time however it could easily have been said 18 years earlier and today it still holds true.<br />\r\nOver these 25 years Donna Regina&rsquo;s music has traveled all around the world: to Poland and Portugal, Argentina, Brazil and even Japan. Maybe it was the other way around: they headed out and unpacked their music where ever they were, as a gift or a sign of friendship. Now they are getting something back, for in the end cover versions are really for those who wrote the original. The tributes here come from very old as well as very new friends, from companions over many years and partners in spirit. And what they have found in Donna Regina&rsquo;s music and what they have done with it, that is a gift for every listener to this wonderful compilation.</div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"352\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qE9T5ndpUl0?list=PL5F7C5FF8FBE43CCC\" width=\"470\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>More infos :&nbsp; <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/DonnaRegina.official\">https://www.facebook.com/DonnaRegina.official</a></div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div><strong>THE 23s</strong></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://karaokekalk.de/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Flamingo_23_s_karaoke_kalk_84_450_450-300x300.jpg\" style=\"height:300px; width:300px\" /></strong></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Welcome back to the movielike resonating sound world of The 23s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Already in 2008 the mysterious one-man band proofed with the album &ldquo;Bolivia&rdquo; that they are trying to do another kind of music &ndash; something that isn&rsquo;t entertainment, something that isn&rsquo;t show, something that goes gently straight to your soul. Now the producer from Nord-Rhine-Westphalia did it again and tuned in the longplayer &ldquo;Flamingo&rdquo;. Anew he delivers a special kind of cinematic journey music that grooves opposite to his other, more rhythm based hypnotic dance productions. Also as The 23s he produces pattern-based music, but it pursues a different intention: each listener should dive into a hallucinatory world of seen and unseen films that his inner eye creates unprejudiced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All ten tracks are romantic smooth operators. They put themselves in service of an artistic vision, in which the listener should get lost in music. The album can be seen as a love-letter to the movie scores of the French 70s cinema or the impressionistic sound arrangements you can hear in the early cinema of Peter Greenaway. With double bass heat, discreet piano melodies, levitating guitar chords, some gentle horns here and there and beats that recollect the warm jazz influenced soul of oldschool hip-hop The 23s generate a sublime get-down-deep instrumental journey. You can listen to it attentive. Or you can just play it in the back while doing whatever you like to do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is recommended to play &ldquo;Flamingo&rdquo; in a decent amount of volume as all loungey tracks begin to live bigger and brighter with sound intensity. If you play it flashy you will experience an atmospheric sometimes light-flooded, sometimes foggy 40-minute electronic journey that offers open-minded souls to fill the room between the notes with their very own milky fancy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Soon the album will be accompanied by a bunch of remixes tuned in and twisted by producers like Giegling and White artists Edward, Christian S of the C&oacute;meme tribe, Canadian producer The Mole and the German post rock and electronic music band To Rococo Rot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More infos :&nbsp; <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/karaoke-kalk/sets/the-23s-flamingo\">https://soundcloud.com/karaoke-kalk/sets/the-23s-flamingo</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>WILL SAMSON &amp; HEIMER</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://karaokekalk.de/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/front_web_rgb_450_450-300x300.jpg\" style=\"height:300px; width:300px\" /></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Animal Hands is the collaborative venture of two close friends, Will Samson &amp; Heimer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>English for Everyone host <a href=\"http://www.willsamson.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Will Samson</a> in the live studio where he plays three songs and chats to Austin.</p>\r\n\r\n<div><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"115\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://www.euradionantes.eu/embed/podcast/10659\" width=\"100%\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the duo had worked closely together as mutual producers on Samson&rsquo;s solo releases, Balance (2012) &amp; Light Shadows (2014), it was natural that a joint musical project would eventually materialise. However, in comparison with these two preceding records, this new body of truly collaborative work takes a different direction into more electronic inspired sounds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The project first appeared in the form of &lsquo;Beacon Island&rsquo; &ndash; a track which arose suddenly &amp; organically during a weekend of email exchanges between Oxfordshire (England) and Berlin (Germany), back in Autumn 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Excited and surprised by the spontaneity of the song&rsquo;s fruition, the pair played with the notion of expanding the project into a full record and continued to casually exchange sketches and ideas &ndash; such as guitar loops, vocal melodies and field recordings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, their d&eacute;but track made its way to the ears of Will Saul (who Samson had met after producing It Grows Again with Tom Demac &ndash; an EP released on Saul&rsquo;s label, Aus Music), which lead to it being featured on his DJ-Kicks album for !K7 (June 2014).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was after a string of tours (including shows with Marissa Nadler, Kurt Vile, Hauschka, Do Make Say Think, &Oacute;lafur Arnalds + more), that Will Samson temporarily relocated to Heimer&rsquo;s native city of Berlin, enabling them to ditch the tedious file sharing method of work for the immediacy of true communion in the studio.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was here where they began meticulously compiling and experimenting with new ideas that, over the course of year, eventually grew into this 9-track album.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each piece of music took on many different shapes, twists and turns during this time, including the previously unplanned addition of live drums. Many early sketches that had been abandoned were reinvestigated &ndash; then sampled, processed and/or reworked, interlacing their way back into the threads of the record. The resulting album is one that strikes a dynamic balance between the immediate &amp; the intricate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More infos :&nbsp; <a href=\"http://www.willsamson.co.uk/\">http://www.willsamson.co.uk/ </a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://heimermusic.com/\">http://heimermusic.com/</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>",

A brand new micro-label and collective unshackled by style or genre, it was formed with a pioneering spirit to reassess how we discover and explore music amid the disorientating digital geography of the 21st century.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lost Map was able to immediately give shelter to an uprooted tribe of amazing artists including Rozi Plain, Kid Canaveral, Seamus Fogarty, Randolph&rsquo;s Leap, eagleowl, Monoganon and Pictish Trail. It&rsquo;s those names and many more yet to be encountered that will lead Lost Map on its creative adventure, through physical and&nbsp;digital releases, events, festivals and all destinations in between.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Interview with Johnny Lynch the head of our European Label of The Month for June, <a href=\"http://lostmap.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Lost Map</a>! </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"115\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://www.euradionantes.eu/embed/podcast/11095\" width=\"100%\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://lostmap.com\">http://lostmap.com</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/LostMap\">https://www.facebook.com/LostMap</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/lostmap\">https://soundcloud.com/lostmap</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>THE ARTISTS / RECORDS</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>TUFF LOVE</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://static1.squarespace.com/static/520030bee4b0929e453bbf09/52220db9e4b0468fe563fa2f/568c385ae0327c72211f7e63/1459760625292/?format=300w\" style=\"height:300px; width:300px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Tuff Love are set to release their three EPs as one 15-track compilation.

They were a labor of love. The tracks are in the order they were released on Junk, Dross and Dregs.&nbsp;We know it&#39;s not an album in the sense that it was written to be an album, but we wanted to put a full stop after the three E.Ps, and releasing them all as &#39;Resort&#39; seems like a cool way to do that!&quot;&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"383\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/suK8dfql8U0\" width=\"682\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>More infos :&nbsp; <a href=\"http://www.reallytufflove.com/\">http://www.reallytufflove.com/</a></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div><strong>ICHI</strong></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://static1.squarespace.com/static/520030bee4b0929e453bbf09/52220db9e4b0468fe563fa2f/56bc4cae20c64756931f4f2f/1459760625288/?format=300w\" style=\"height:302px; width:300px\" /></strong></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Lost Map Records are thrilled to welcome Bristol-based Japanese experimental singer-songwriter, instrument- maker and performance artist ICHI to the label for the release of his playful masterstroke of a third album <em>Maru</em>. It will be released on limited-edition cut cover CD and download on March 18, 2016, and is preceded by the single&lsquo;2 Klaxons&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hailing from Nagoya&rsquo;s underground scene, ICHI moved to the UK and Bristol after meeting English singer-songwriter Rachael Dadd, now his wife, at a small DIY festival in his hometown. He takes inspiration for his art from far and wide &ndash; a melting-pot of punk, reggae and dub, Henri Salvador, tribal music and old scratchy 78s. With his trusty sampler never far away ICHI spends hours poised, ready to capture the perfect water droplet or page flick, a process which he describes as being &ldquo;like catching an animal&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recorded entirely onto a four-track tape machine in his attic studio, <em>Maru</em> finds ICHI layering Heath Robinson-esque song-scapes crafted out of found objects and bizarre homemade instruments (stilt-bass, kalilaphone, hatbox-pedal-drum, skip-xylophone and tapumpet) with vocals depicting colourful characters. The album features guest vocals from This Is The Kit frontwoman Kate Stables,&nbsp;Rachael Dadd and Lost Map&rsquo;s own Rozi Plain.&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"434\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ujv9CwUqRpg\" width=\"772\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>More infos : <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ICHImusic/\">https://www.facebook.com/ICHImusic/</a></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div><strong>ROZI PLAIN</strong></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://static1.squarespace.com/static/520030bee4b0929e453bbf09/52220db9e4b0468fe563fa2f/5523b4bfe4b00e3b3287e09a/1464115665534/?format=300w\" style=\"height:300px; width:300px\" /></strong></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Rozi Plain&rsquo;s exquisite third album <em>Friend</em>, was released on May 4, 2015. A spellbinding reaffirmation of the London-based, Winchester-born singer-songwriter as one of the most unique and original voices in UK alt-folk, <em>Friend</em> features contributions from Hot Chip&#39;s Alexis Taylor and members of François &amp; The Atlas Mountains among many others.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Partly a breakup album, partly a beacon of bad times gotten through if never forgotten, <em>Friend</em> is a deeply meaningful and wonderfully measured ode to memory, place, companionship and music&rsquo;s remarkable power as an emotional salve. Typical of Rozi&rsquo;s instinctive sense of compositional freedom and unpredictability, &lsquo;Best Team&rsquo; juxtaposes busy percussion with mellow strings and warm breezes of brass, hurrying busily on its way towards no place in particular. &lsquo;Jogalong&rsquo; drops into the middle of the album as if from a different cosmos, full of tensely circling guitars, heavenly backing vocals and synth lines that orbit like flying saucers. The gossamer &lsquo;Red Dot&rsquo; is <em>Friend</em>&rsquo;s emotional sucker punch, downbeat but somehow uplifting, as Rozi ponders the passing of time and the triviality of marking a date of regrettable significance in the calendar &ldquo;with a red dot or do you think a green dot?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/H4S0ME8Xyc0\" width=\"503\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>More infos :&nbsp; <a href=\"http://roziplain.co.uk/\">http://roziplain.co.uk/</a></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div><strong>INSECT HEROES</strong></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://static1.squarespace.com/static/520030bee4b0929e453bbf09/52220db9e4b0468fe563fa2f/540e42e0e4b0067310ac53bd/1459760626559/?format=300w\" style=\"height:300px; width:300px\" /></strong></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Introducing &hellip;&nbsp;self-styled purveyors of &ldquo;tropical pop for the Apocalypse&rdquo;, <strong>Insect Heroes</strong>!&nbsp;Their weirdly irresistible &ndash; or irresistibly weird, if you&rsquo;d prefer &ndash; debut album <em>Apocalypso</em> will be released on October 13th&nbsp;&hellip; and you can pre-order it now for a special&nbsp;price.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Insect Heroes&nbsp;are a collection of classic British eccentrics and oddballs, based loosely around two nomadic doom&nbsp;mongers&nbsp;and mountaineering enthusiasts in the shape of Peak District born-and-raised, Scotland-&nbsp;based brothers George and&nbsp;Evan Thomas. In addition, the current line-up also includes fellow pilgrims&nbsp;Robin Ashton, Adam Campbell and Laurie Pitt,&nbsp;variously assigned to modular synthesiser, keytar,&nbsp;banjo, drums and percussion. It&rsquo;s a surreal and psychedelic landscape&nbsp;they create, through which&nbsp;George&rsquo;s helium-filled vocals and bittersweet lyricism drift like lost balloons, or clouds with&nbsp;silver&nbsp;linings. Expect huge pop hooks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Apocalypso</em>&nbsp;was recorded to 16 track analogue tape between May 2011 and November 2012 at&nbsp;Green Door Studio in&nbsp;Glasgow, with engineering from Emily Maclaren and Stuart Evans, and&nbsp;mastering by Sam Smith. Inspired by mountain&nbsp;climbs and long drives over the Pennines,&nbsp;transcendence on the dancefloor, music as an opiate and searching for the&nbsp;kind of love that lasts, it&rsquo;s&nbsp;a curious and kaleidoscopically trippy collection, and yet eminently accessible too,&nbsp;framing&nbsp;George&rsquo;s&nbsp;idiosyncratically skewed view of the world in all its mundane glory and evidencing his exceptional&nbsp;fluency in pop&nbsp;as a truly universal language.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lead single&nbsp;&lsquo;King Fabulous&rsquo;&nbsp;is an addictive shot of 60s&nbsp;garage-psyche propelled by an&nbsp;infectious cowbell beat, proving that driving with the top down and&nbsp;drinking in the VIP lounge&nbsp;isn&rsquo;t the&nbsp;preserve of bling-dripping R&amp;B stars but merely a state of mind.&nbsp;&lsquo;Beautiful World&rsquo;&nbsp;sings to the death grip intensity of true romance amid the&nbsp;early-morning dregs of a&nbsp;party, with a chorus none more toxically euphoric than&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so happy, I could die&rdquo;.&nbsp;The&nbsp;mesmerising&nbsp;&lsquo;Wooden Heart&rsquo;&nbsp;represents George&rsquo;s attempt to pen &ldquo;a classic soul song&rdquo;,&nbsp;and was hailed by&nbsp;The&nbsp;Guardian&nbsp;as&nbsp;&ldquo;an extremely lovely slice of dreamy melancholia&rdquo; when&nbsp;it was released under the&nbsp;group&rsquo;s then&nbsp;working title of the&nbsp;Thomas Brothers as part of a Green Door Studio compilation in 2011.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to George, ever a cheerful fella, the concept of&nbsp;Insect Heroes&nbsp;was born from&nbsp;&ldquo;years of&nbsp;failure, both as a musician&nbsp;and human being&rdquo;. There is a dark core to even the&nbsp;band&rsquo;s&nbsp;most upbeat&nbsp;tunes.&nbsp;&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t have much else to hope for, so I&nbsp;just tried quite obsessively to make music that&nbsp;sounded like the way I saw the world,&rdquo;&nbsp;he continues.&nbsp;&ldquo;To me it&rsquo;s just&nbsp;straight pop, but then other&nbsp;people describe it as being weird. The world is pretty weird though. With&nbsp;Insect Heroes&nbsp;it&rsquo;s just&nbsp;nice to&nbsp;have found some other people who have noticed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6HRoKL51Zyc\" width=\"854\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>More infos : <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Insect-Heroes-128288870648917/\">https://www.facebook.com/Insect-Heroes-128288870648917/</a></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div><strong>RANDOLPH&#39;S LEAP</strong></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://static1.squarespace.com/static/520030bee4b0929e453bbf09/52220db9e4b0468fe563fa2f/55341691e4b046e70a5f7fed/1459760625708/?format=300w\" style=\"height:300px; width:300px\" /></strong></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Randolph&rsquo;s Leap</strong> are a Glasgow-based musical project ranging from a solo act to an eight-piece band.

Say hello to Death By Unga Bunga and their new album Pineapple Pizza.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Death By Unga Bunga (DBUB) are five nasty guys from Moss, the garage rock capital of Norway, and just like in fairytales formed with lead singer Sebastian Ulstad Olsen holding auditions in his own garage. Since then DBUB have restlessly visited town after town, village after village spreading their energetic mix of garage, psychedelia and power pop to an increasingly bigger audience. Seeing them live an experience you&rsquo;ll never forget, an experience that&rsquo;s best described as being hit by a rock&rsquo;n&rsquo;roll tornado.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Death by Unga Bunga never hold their fire and Pineapple Pizza is no exception. The album is the band&rsquo;s fourth in five years and its 12 songs, from start to finish, showcase what the band has become known for: hot guitar riffs, irresistible choruses and a rhythm section with burning feet and fingers. &ldquo;Musically it&rsquo;s a protest against bad rock&rsquo;n&rsquo;roll,&rdquo; says guitarist Stian Gulbrandsen. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about demanding processed cheese, intoxication, high peaks, fun and love. But also about the pain from taking in too much of it.&rdquo; Pineapple Pizza was produced by the band, with Morten &Oslash;by (The Lionheart Brothers/Pirate Love) behind the controls during the mixing and the studio.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pineapple Pizza is the first LP to be released in North America and is the follow up to the band&rsquo;s Tell Me Why EP which came out this past Fall. The EP&rsquo;s title track appears on the album and was also released as a single, peaking at #7 on specialty radio and in Top 50 on the college charts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With Pineapple Pizza DBUB have created an effortless and infectious continuation of the group&rsquo;s love for quality music from the 60s and the 70s. Artists like 13th Floor Elevators, The Sonics, The Mummies (who named them), Cheap Trick, Ramones and The Byrds at their most colourful. Death by Unga Bunga are combining the best from our musical heritage, adding a timeless energy, and mixing it into a strong contemporary form of expression. Death by Unga Bunga will be spending 2016 all over the world: don&rsquo;t miss one of Norway&rsquo;s very best live bands when they visit your hometown. You should order a pizza on the way.</p>\r\n\r\n<div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SmzPLDnKYkk\" width=\"750\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>More infos :&nbsp; <a href=\"http://www.deathbyungabunga.no/\">http://www.deathbyungabunga.no/</a></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div><strong>ATLANTER</strong></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.jansenplateproduksjon.no/jansenweb2013/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/JANSEN060-DIGITAL-200x200.jpg\" style=\"height:200px; width:200px\" /></strong></div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Atlanter washed over Norway like a monster wave in 2013. Their debut album, Vidde, became a favourite among both record buyers and critics, with its beautiful and natural mix of African desert blues, American delta blues and German &ldquo;motorik&rdquo; from the 70s. &ldquo;Vidde blues&rdquo; was a new and self-made term at that time &ndash; a term that summed up the quartet&rsquo;s wish of uniting music from several corners of the world in &ldquo;norwegianized&rdquo; and timeless attire. They fully succeeded. &ldquo;Atlanter are a straightforward pleasure&rdquo;, the NME wrote about their debut album. With a Norwegian &laquo;Grammy&raquo; nomination and several high positions in some critics&rsquo; summaries of the music year 2013, we&rsquo;re allowed to have high expectations. The Atlanter wave is here again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&laquo;Jewels of Crime&raquo; is both a natural sequel and a long step forward for the quartet. An album that Atlanter have spent three long years recording, but that really has provided musical gems. Arild Hammer&oslash; (guitar, vocal), Jens J Carelius Krogsveen (guitar, vocal), Jonas Barsten (drums) and Morten Kvam (bass) have all the time kept and developed their astounding knack for improvisation, their joy of playing and their intuitive musical understanding, which also in a live setting is central to the band&rsquo;s sound. They&rsquo;re proving on &laquo;Jewels of Crime&raquo; that they also master the art of songwriting completely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ndash; Before the studio recordings, we listened to loads of jams and rehearsals, picking out compositions, intensity and, not least, ensemble playing, which we thought could become songs. I think we had up to 250 recordings which altogether formed the basis of the songs. Because that&rsquo;s still the key to why this band works so well: People with different approaches and musical tastes who love playing together, Jens J Carelius Krogsveen says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The album was recorded at Engfelt &amp; Forsgrens Studio, Brageveien Studio, ARC and Pooka Studios in Oslo plus Ocean Sound Recordings at Giske outside of &Aring;lesund. So it&rsquo;s not just in the music that the band&rsquo;s restless and nomadic nature emerges. The mixing was done in New York by Abe Seiferth, known for his work with dissimilar artists like Yeasayer, Ornette Coleman and Simian Mobile Disco. Among the album&rsquo;s guests we find the group Imarhan from Mali, with Iyad Moussa Ben Abderahmane a.k.a. Sadam on vocals. Sadam is also known as the singer in Tinariwen&rsquo;s live line-up. On the track &laquo;Jareeze&raquo;, another Jansen artist appears: Hanne Kolst&oslash; on vocals. The album was produced by Erlend Mokkelbost and &Oslash;yvind R&oslash;srud Gundersen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ndash; The title &ldquo;Jewels of Crime&rdquo; deals with these thematics: &ldquo;Even though things are shiny, it doesn&rsquo;t mean they&rsquo;re working&rdquo;. We wanted to present such an old-fashioned thing like a rock band in a kitschy, glossy and gaudy universe, Krogsveen says.</p>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"883\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/t28qZaC4quk\" width=\"1570\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>More infos :&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.atlantermusic.com\">http://www.atlantermusic.com</a></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div><strong>HANNE KOLSTO</strong></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.jansenplateproduksjon.no/jansenweb2013/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/JANSEN058-200x200.jpg\" style=\"height:200px; width:200px\" /></strong></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Hanne Kolst&oslash; rotates like a waterspout. Every year she sweeps past us with things she&rsquo;s picked up and put down on a record, so that we, the other people, get the feeling that we&rsquo;re standing completely still while she&rsquo;s going in slow circles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In early November, Kolst&oslash; releases her fifth album in five years. An over-ambitious project for for most people, but Kolst&oslash; says that the concept enforced itself during her the work with her first four albums.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&rdquo;Five albums. Five years of my life. Five years where the lyrics gradually have become more important, where I feel I&rsquo;ve found out more about how I look upon life and people around me and myself in all this. Five years with many different emotions&rdquo;, Hanne says of the years that have passed since her first solo album, Riot Break, was released.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Three out of Kolst&oslash;&rsquo;s four previous albums was nominated to the Spellemann award, and they&rsquo;ve all received great reviews both at home and abroad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It feels only natural to finish with an album which is about goodbyes:<br />\r\n&ldquo;While We Still Have Light&rdquo; mirrors the goodbye theme, which can be interpreted in many different ways. In the middle of this is doubt; the doubt before a decision, the doubt before you choose to break out of bad patterns, the doubt before you choose to leave a friend or a boyfriend, before you choose to enter a darkness, in the hope that maybe there&rsquo;s more light on the other side&rdquo;, Kolst&oslash; continues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Luckily this is not a final goodbye to Kolst&oslash; as an artist, even though she says that after every album she gives herself a freedom of choice: Is this what she wants to continue doing? And we&rsquo;re happy that Hanne Kolst&oslash; continues to pour out her seemingly inexhaustible cornucopia of good melodies, personal lyrics and musical distinctiveness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Parts of While We Still Have Light were recorded at Ocean Sound Recordings at Giske, situated about an hour&rsquo;s drive from Kolst&oslash;&rsquo;s home town, Sykkylven.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her producer and collaborator through many years, &Oslash;yvind R&oslash;srud Gundersen, has this time been more involved in the writing process, which among other things has led to an extensive use of two drumkits, as they both are so fond of playing drums.<br />\r\nEivind Buene, one of Norway&rsquo;s most renowned contemporary classical composers, wrote the string arrangements.</p>\r\n\r\n<div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"540\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DUzlQMxdiZk\" width=\"960\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>More infos :&nbsp; <a href=\"http://hannekolstoe.com\">http://hannekolstoe.com</a></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div><strong>BAND OF GOLD</strong></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.jansenplateproduksjon.no/jansenweb2013/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/JANSEN056-200x200.jpg\" style=\"height:200px; width:200px\" /></strong></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Gold comes in many carats, but rarely as noble as Band of Gold&rsquo;s eponymous debut album. Because, what began as a pile of homemade demo recordings by singer, composer and multi-instrumentalist Nina Elisabeth Mortvedt, now appears as a gilded whole. In co-operation with the duo&rsquo;s other half, musician and producer Nikolai H&aelig;ngsle Eilertsen, Band of Gold has become a timeless album, full of musical details, the urge to explore and the genuine art of songwriting. An album crammed with ambitious pop music, just like good and innovative pop music is meant to sound like in 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of heart and soul behind Band of Gold, but also many working hours and long thought processes. For Nikolai it soon became clear that the goose bumps her music gave him wasn&rsquo;t a coincidence, when he approached the song sketches Nina had sent him. Beautiful but desperate songs with her ethereal voice and a backing track consisting of a one-string guitar and Prince samples. He soon realized that his role in this project would go far beyond the traditional role of a producer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Band of Gold is a record where a lot of time has been spent in the studio. Not necessarily a lot of time on the perfect take, but a lot of time has been spent on experimenting towards the perfect detail and shade. Nina and Nikolai are the architects who have brought in musicians that have been able to process their joint musical ideas instead of colouring the music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Olaf Olsen (Todd Terje, Bigbang), Tomas Pettersen (King Midas) and Kenneth Kapstad (Motorpsycho, M&oslash;ster!) appear on drums, while Dungen guitarist Reine Fiske has contributed on guitar and bass. Various keyboards have been played by Morten Qvenild (In The Country) and David Wallumr&oslash;d, while Lars Horntveth (Jaga Jazzist) has written arrangements for horns that he plays himself along with Ketil Vestrum Einarsen and Erik Johannesen. On the final track, &ldquo;For You&rdquo;, Martin Hagfors contributes with his vocals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But first and foremost this is the work of Nina and Nikolai. A musical freedom project where they can live out their taste in music to the full. With their very different backgrounds from jazz to country and rock, both have visited overgrown musical paths, but most of all they have trodden new paths. Electronic and acoustic sounds are mixed in new and exciting ways and form a warm and organic soundtrack around Nina&rsquo;s characteristic vocals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the hypnotic &ldquo;But In The Movie Baby&rdquo; to the epic &ldquo;Ready&rdquo;. From the electronic &ldquo;Wishes&rdquo; to the grandiose debut single &ldquo;The Parade&rdquo;. Band of Gold has become a varied album with Mortvedt&rsquo;s universe of lyrics as the definitive thread. Lyrics about trying to get on with your life after a tragedy, about change when everything is about to unravel. About pulling yourself up and looking forward. This is an album with enough musical highlights for a lifetime. These times really are golden.</p>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/IpgApO9N7Zo\" width=\"854\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>More infos :&nbsp; <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/bandofgoldofficial/\">https://www.facebook.com/bandofgoldofficial/</a></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div><strong>BROR FORSGREN</strong></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.jansenplateproduksjon.no/jansenweb2013/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Jansen052-200x200.jpg\" style=\"height:200px; width:200px\" /></strong></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>When Bror Forsgren (The Lionheart Brothers, Jaga Jazzist, Silence The Foe) is making his solo debut at the age of 34, he doesn&rsquo;t go easy on anything. As the title on the great art deco-inspirered cover indicates at first sight, &laquo;Narcissus&raquo; is a grandiose and uncompromising piece of pop music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The album&rsquo;s theme is centred around the big questions. Lost love, innocence and faith in God are all important elements in the universe Bror Forsgren has created for &laquo;Narcissus&raquo;. The arrangements, which none other than TrondheimSolistene have orchestrated, are grandiose and intricate. Despite its &laquo;wall of sound&raquo;-approach and several prominent musical guests (Lars Horntveth, Mathias Eick, Marte Eberson and others), the album still comes across as an intensely personal affair.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bror Forsgren himself describes the album like this:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- I&rsquo;ve always dreamed of making an album with grand orchestration, whilst managing to keep the music timeless. I&rsquo;m a big fan of Scott Walker and loves his ability to intertwine velvety pop music and modern composition. My vision for this album has been to create a work where my natural pop habitat melts together with the classical and the modern.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Already on the opening track, &laquo;Waiting For That Holy Music&raquo;, it&rsquo;s clear that this isn&rsquo;t just any album. Its musical landscape evokes the previously mentioned Scott Walker and other greats like The Beach Boys, Brian Eno and Ennio Morricone. But &laquo;Narcissus&raquo; is by no means an exercise in the name of pastiche art. The way Bror Forsgren takes elements from these greats and builds his own sonic cathedral, shows that he&rsquo;s an impressively confident artist with a clear vision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The album&rsquo;s nine songs form a fascinating musical journey where we join Forsgren down to the deepest valleys. Luckily, you might say, there&rsquo;s also light at the end of the tunnel. In several ways this anecdote from Bror Forsgren&rsquo;s trip from Oslo to Trondheim to record TrondheimSolistene, illustrates the album very well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- I arrived early at the railway station, but because of delays and technical problems with the airport express train, I had to take a taxi to Gardermoen airport. Five minutes before my flight&rsquo;s departure time, I arrived at the airport and ran through the security check. If I didn&rsquo;t catch this flight, the whole recording, lots of money and the album I&rsquo;d been working on for two years would go down the drain. When I arrived at gate 23, I discovered that the flight had been moved to gate 19. I ran the long way to that gate, but when I finally arrived there, the gate had only just closed. I tearfully explained my situation to one of the officials at the gate, who despite strict regulations let me come on board. And thus &laquo;Narcissus&raquo; became a reality, Forsgren says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In other words it&rsquo;s been a long, difficult and, at times, dark process. But on the other hand, with &laquo;Narcissus&raquo; in his back pocket, Bror Forsgren has landed on his own two feet. However, he gladly admits that his many supporters and musicians have been invaluable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- I&rsquo;m very lucky to have been joined by so many competent people and I&rsquo;m extremely grateful for this. Without all their help &laquo;Narcissus&raquo; wouldn&rsquo;t have existed.</p>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_X62-RCbGOo\" width=\"854\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>More infos :&nbsp; <a href=\"http://www.brorforsgren.com\">http://www.brorforsgren.com</a></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div><strong>UNDERGRUNNEN</strong></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.jansenplateproduksjon.no/jansenweb2013/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/JANSEN050-200x200.jpg\" style=\"height:200px; width:200px\" /></strong></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>In spring 2014 Per Steinar Lie (of The Low Frequency in Stereo) received a call from Haugesund prison, Norway. They needed a band to play for the inmates at very short notice or more specifically, the very next day. The only problem was that only one other member of The Low Frequency in Stereo (&Oslash;rjan Haaland) was in town. However, P&aring;l Jackman (of Wunderkammer) had just moved back to town so Steinar Lie decided to give him a call. The next day the three of them set up their equipment at the prison, and without a single rehearsal or any clear idea of what might happen next, they performed on stage in front of the inmates of Haugesund prison and thus Undergr&uuml;nnen was born.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A year later Undergr&uuml;nnen, made up of members from several of Haugesund&rsquo;s proudest musical exports, are ready to release their eponymous debut self-titled album. The band consists of P&aring;l Jackman (Wunderkammer), Per Steinar Lie (The Low Frequency In Stereo, Lumen Drones) and &Oslash;rjan Haaland (The Low Frequency In Stereo, Lumen Drones), and with a fistful of kraut rock, a good dose of energy and a pinch of afrobeat, Jackman, Steiner Lie and Haaland are ready to push the boundaries of garage rock.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Undergr&uuml;nnen&rsquo;s debut album consists of nine tracks which all stem from jamming in the studio (with the exception of &lsquo;Dommedag i E&rsquo;, &lsquo;&Oslash;rkesl&oslash;s fryd&rsquo; and &lsquo;Tennene i no stort&rsquo;, which were all conceived in Haugesund prison in Spring 2014), boiled down to compact and catchy energy blowouts that demand movement. The album was recorded at Hauge Chess Club recording studio and was mixed in ABC Studio Etne and Broen Studio in Bergen. Mastered by Jason Emberton (Nick Cave), the end result is an impressive, cultured and energetic debut album. It is rich in detail and demonstrates the three indie veterans from Haugesunds willingness and ability to renew themselves and the rock genre within which they operate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Explaining Undergr&uuml;nnen&rsquo;s characteristic sound Per Steinar (bass / backing vocals) says, &ldquo;We wanted to create a very intense band based in Haugesund, with roots in both primitive rock and afro rock. P&aring;l has played in a band from Ivory Coast and I&rsquo;ve been a roadie for Andy Brown and the Storm from Zimbabwe. Our ambition is to mix the African sound with the Norwegian language. Of course we emphasize that we play a Norwegian type of afro rock, and we regard it as a mix where MC5 meets African rhythms.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QsnQEbc0tO4\" width=\"750\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>More infos :&nbsp; <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/undergrunnen/\">https://www.facebook.com/undergrunnen/</a></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div><strong>DANIEL KVAMMEN</strong></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.jansenplateproduksjon.no/jansenweb2013/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/JANSEN045-200x200.jpg\" style=\"height:200px; width:200px\" /></strong></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>26 year-old Daniel Kvammen grew up in Geilo, a small town with 2363 inhabitants, which is more known for its annual invasion of skiing tourists, and the fact that it is halfway on the Bergen railway.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With his debut album &ldquo;Fremad i alle retninga&rdquo;, Kvammn shows that age or hometown don&rsquo;t matter when you set things in motion to make an impressively complete and emotionally charged first record. The first single &ldquo;Du fortenar ein som meg&rdquo; set the tone with equal parts youthful drive and mature lyrics. For the first time in its history, national radio station NRK P3 embraced a song sung in Geilo dialect. The rest of &ldquo;Fremad i alle retninga&rdquo; takes you into a diverse and exciting universe of songs, in which Kvammen lets both inner demons, everyday tales and tiny moments of joy come to the surface. Or, as Daniel says himself; &ldquo;<em>My songs are mostly conversations with myself, about me and those around me. Stories about people trying too hard and people not shutting up.&rdquo; </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Daniel wrote his first songs as a teenager at work, where he was originally hired to control the ski lift in one of the many ski resorts in Geilo. Much to the despair of his boss and the tanned skiing tourists, it was the guitar, the pen and the paper that got Kvammen&rsquo;s attention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And now that the debut album &ldquo;Fremad i alle retninga&rdquo; is finally here, we can say with certainty that the young boy had his priorities straight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Fremad i alle retninga&rdquo; is produced by renowned musician and producer Even Ormestad from Jaga Jazzist, who has contributed on and produced several award-winning albums. Other than Daniel&rsquo;s regular live band, some of Norway&rsquo;s best studio musicians are also playing on the record. Among the musicians are David Wallumr&oslash;d on various keys, Martin Horntveth on drums and previously mentioned Even Ormestad on bass.</p>\r\n\r\n<div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"293\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4g4z92FkRpI\" width=\"520\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>More infos :&nbsp; <a href=\"http://www.danielkvammen.no/\">http://www.danielkvammen.no/</a></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div><strong>THEA &amp; THE WILD</strong></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.jansenplateproduksjon.no/jansenweb2013/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/JANSEN040-200x200.jpg\" style=\"height:200px; width:200px\" /></strong></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Thea &amp; The Wild&rsquo;s brilliant debut album is out now. This is a release that comes with high expectations and has already gotten rave reviews in Norway.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite her young age, Thea Glenton Raknes is quite experienced in the Norwegian music industry. She has gained a lot of said experience as a songwriter, lyricist, frontwoman, and now as a producer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the project Thea &amp; The Wild, she produces bold pop music that truly is catchy. The songs can be found in an alternative musical landscape, where playful pop melodies are mixed with elements of synth pop and classic rock. The soundscape is inspired by Thea&rsquo;s love for the organic, with a warm bass, playful retro guitars, analogue synths and a focus on melodies and rhythm. Glenton&rsquo;s characteristic vocals serves as a guide through the songs, and it is all elegantly produced by Kenneth Ishak (Beeswax, Heyerdahl), and Thea herself. Ishak also contributes as the only other musician on the album, in addition to Thea.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;<em>The songs I have made for this album are pop songs the way I like them; with clear choruses and lively melodies and rhythms. The lyrics may be a little dark, as I tend to write them from what struggles I have in my head. But this is a record you can smile to, dance down the pavement to, or play loudly in the car in the summer, while you dream of falling in love or reminisce about heartbrea</em>k&rdquo;, says Thea.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before the album&rsquo;s release, Thea has already played at both the Hove and the &Oslash;ya festival. The latter gig was rewarded with 5 out of 6 on the dice in newspaper Aftenposten&rsquo;s review. In addition, she was recently handpicked as an opening act for Sivert H&oslash;yem&rsquo;s Norwegian tour, which introduced Thea &amp; The Wild to a large and wide audience across the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The musicians in her band are the following: Kenneth Ishak (Beezewax, Heyerdahl), &Aring;dne Meisfjord (120 days), Stina Moltu Marklund (Stina Stjern, Supervixen) and Joachim Amundsen Trana (Hypertext, Casiokids). During 2013, they have already become a captivating, tight and experienced live band, and they have received nothing but good testimonials following their performances.</p>\r\n\r\n<div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9M4EXxiagxY\" width=\"463\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>More infos :&nbsp; <a href=\"http://www.theaandthewild.com\">http://www.theaandthewild.com</a></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Ancien leader des groupes Toy Fight et (Please) Don&rsquo;t Blame Mexico, Maxime Chamoux jouait jusqu&rsquo;ici une musique situ&eacute;e entre le rock nord-am&eacute;ricain de Spoon et Neutral Milk Hotel et la pop anglaise sophistiqu&eacute;e de Prefab Sprout et XTC.<br />\r\nEt puis, il a d&eacute;cid&eacute; de larguer les amarres: &ldquo;<em>Je commen&ccedil;ais &agrave; m&rsquo;ennuyer de l&rsquo;indie rock et avoir envie d&rsquo;autre chose, </em>explique-t-il<em>.

    "content": "<h2>THE LABEL</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Founded in 1996 Fortuna POP! is an independent record label with an emphasis on melodic indiepop with strong lyrics inspired in equal parts by DJ John Peel and early eighties labels such as Postcard,&nbsp;Creation and Sarah Records. From early successes such as The Butterflies Of Love, The Aislers Set and Australian indiepop heroes The Lucksmiths the label continued to grow with bands such as Peel-faves Bearsuit,&nbsp;Comet Gain and ex-Hefner main man Darren Hayman, but it was the signing of The Pains Of Being Pure At Heart, Allo Darlin&rsquo;, Crystal Stilts and Herman Dune that really took the label to the next level.&nbsp;Now home to a new generation of bands such as Joanna Gruesome, Withered Hand, The September Girls, Martha, The Spook School, Flowers and Chain &amp; The Gang, Fortuna POP!&nbsp;continues to be a haven for the nurturing of exciting independent talent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://fortunapop.com/\" target=\"_blank\">http://fortunapop.com/</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://fr-fr.facebook.com/Fortuna-POP-202756739792517/\" target=\"_blank\">https://fr-fr.facebook.com/Fortuna-POP-202756739792517/</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>THE ARTISTS / RECORDS</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>PETER ASTOR</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.fortunapop.com/web_images/FPOP193.jpg\" style=\"height:401px; width:400px\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<div>Spilt Milk is the brand new album from indie auteur Pete Astor, previously of The Loft, The Weather Prophets, and other esteemed acts. It was recorded onto &frac12; inch tape at the home studio of James Hoare of Ultimate Painting, The Proper Ornaments and Veronica Falls, with James playing guitar, bass, drums, keyboards and singing backing vocals. <em>&ldquo;He was&rdquo;</em>, says Astor, <em>&ldquo;an amazing band.&rdquo;</em> Other contributions came from members of Astor&#39;s live band, with Pam Berry (Black Tambourine, Withered Hand) supplying vocals, Jack Hayter (Hefner) on pedal steel, Alison Cotton (The Left Outsides) on viola, and Robin Christian (Male Bonding) and Susan Milanovic (Feathers) on drums.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe album has all the hallmarks of a future Pete Astor classic, drawing together key strands and tributaries of his work over the years, blending intuitive songwriting, acute lyrics and incisive melodies. After many years making more experimental, electronic music Astor has come full circle to the sound that made his name. He explains, <em>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m back to being myself, bringing together sounds that I&rsquo;ve used over time to make a record that sounds more like me than me!&rdquo;</em><br />\r\n<br />\r\nFrom the opening track &ldquo;Really Something&rdquo; to the recent single &ldquo;Mr Music&rdquo; (a favourite of Marc Riley and Gideon Coe on BBC 6 music) the album&rsquo;s re-connects Astor&rsquo;s bespoke guitar pop with his long-standing embrace of The Velvet Underground&rsquo;s musical DNA. Other standout tracks include &ldquo;My Right Hand&rdquo;, a hymn to everyone&rsquo;s best friend, with guest appearances from Tony Hancock, Marvin Gaye, Philip Larkin and a host of ex-girlfriends; the slow burning drama of &ldquo;The Getting There&rdquo; recalling the atmospheres of Astor&rsquo;s 80s kindred spirits, The Go-Betweens. Also, there is the wry drive of &ldquo;Very Good Lock&rdquo;, summed up by Astor as <em>&ldquo;a description of an injurious medical condition that often affects the male of the species&rdquo;</em>. Elsewhere there are the gorgeous harmonies of the grown up country lament &ldquo;Good Enough&rdquo;, which wouldn&rsquo;t be out of place on one of George Jones&rsquo; most heartbroken albums.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSpilt Milk is part of a continuum: from Astor&rsquo;s beginnings with The Loft and The Weather Prophets on Creation Records in the 1980s, via his solo work through the 1990s and his more left field albums with The Wisdom of Harry and Ellis Island Sound on Matador Records, Heavenly and Peacefrog, through to his return to solo work with the Songbox album in 2012. As well as this ongoing musical activity, Astor is also Senior Lecturer at the University of Westminster, where he teaches, researches and writes about music; 2014 saw the publication of his study of Richard Hell and the Voidoids&rsquo; Blank Generation as part of Bloomsbury&rsquo;s 33 1/3 Series.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAstor remains in touch, engaged and vital in a way that is rare with someone with such longevity. The album continues the story of one of England&rsquo;s most respected and significant songwriters. As Astor says, <em>&ldquo;time passes, shit happens; some losses, some gains. Don&rsquo;t cry &ndash; but I did!&rdquo;</em><br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is Spilt Milk.</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2Ihym05obto\" width=\"560\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<p>More infos : <a href=\"http://peteastor.com/\" target=\"_blank\">http://peteastor.com/</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FLOWERS</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.fortunapop.com/web_images/FPOP194.jpg\" style=\"height:360px; width:360px\" /></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s something great about a three-piece &ndash; think The Cocteau Twins, The Clean, Galaxie 500 &ndash; and the way that irreducible nucleus takes its strength from its limitations, making a virtue of its purity. And so it is with London trio Flowers, returning with their second album Everybody&#39;s Dying To Meet You in February 2016 via Fortuna Pop! (EU) and Kanine (US). Over the course of ten intensely thrilling pop songs, singer Rachel Kenedy&#39;s ethereal vocals and Sam Ayres textured guitar are backed by the powerful, metronomic beat of drummer Jordan Hockley.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFlowers began with Sam&rsquo;s year-long search for a singer, and when he posted one last fateful advert, stating he wanted to make pop songs like <em>&quot;early Madonna through a broken tape machine&quot;</em>, this led him to Rachel. Right away the two fell into a deeply creative and romantic partnership. Currently sharing a flat in East London with their adorable dog Batman, they restore vintage musical equipment and feverishly record demos.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe first batch, polished up by none other than Bernard Butler, turned into debut Do What You Want To, It&#39;s What You Should Do released in 2013. Created during a period of illness for Ayres, the result is an album that, while exquisite in its own way, is necessarily subdued in tone.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor Everybody&rsquo;s Dying to Meet You the band retreated to Bark Studios in Walthamstow to work with producer Brian O&#39;Shaughnessey (The Clientele, Primal Scream, My Bloody Valentine), a return home for Sam, who was born and spent most of his life in the area. It proved to be the perfect fit for Flowers, the sessions enabling them to capture the essence of both their dynamic live sound and their distortion-laden home demos. Effortlessly blending pop songs with noise while leaving space for more stripped back elements, the recordings strike a perfect balance between the sweetness of Rachel&rsquo;s voice and Sam&rsquo;s abrasive guitar stylings. Their musical inspirations, from shoegaze, C86 and New Zealand&rsquo;s Flying Nun label, are now evident.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe infuriatingly catchy first single and opening track &ldquo;Pull My Arm&rdquo; nearly didn&rsquo;t make it onto the album. Written during rehearsals for their tour with Luna after album recording sessions had finished, the band hastily booked another day at Bark and laid it down the day after the tour finished. Band favourite &ldquo;Ego Loss&rdquo; began with Sam playing with a new guitar pedal and writing a punk number&hellip; before the addition of Rachel&rsquo;s words saw it morph into something completely different. Other highlights include the pop rush of &ldquo;Bitter Pill&rdquo; and the mesmeric, slow-burning &ldquo;Intrusive Thoughts&rdquo;.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nArmed with a youthful intensity and determination that shows in their songs, Flowers have succeeded in harnessing their singular magic. Exuberant and electrifying, Everybody&rsquo;s Dying To Meet You crackles with confidence.</p>\r\n\r\n<div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7OWTNCJ5npU\" width=\"560\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<p>More infos : <a href=\"https://fr-fr.facebook.com/flowersdomusic/\" target=\"_blank\">https://fr-fr.facebook.com/flowersdomusic/</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>STEVEN JAMES ADAMS</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.fortunapop.com/web_images/FPOP195.jpg\" style=\"height:360px; width:360px\" /></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Old Magick is the second solo album by Steven James Adams, former songwriter/singer/guitarist from the critically acclaimed Broken Family Band, and proof that Adams&rsquo;s gift for marrying exceptional lyrics with inescapable earworms is very much intact.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith minimal instrumentation, Old Magick is, in part, a reaction to Adam&rsquo;s first solo outing House Music (2013), an album recorded in his living room and featuring an array of musical friends, including members of bands as disparate as pop-rockers The Vaccines and folk-idols Lau.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis time around, he relocated to The Premises studios in Hackney with producer Dan Michaelson at the helm. &ldquo;The irony of going somewhere a bit more high-tech to make something with less people and instrumentation wasn&rsquo;t lost on me&rdquo;, notes Adams. With Michaelson also adding guitar and piano - lending his distinctive, pared-down style to many of the songs - and drums from Daniel Fordham (The Drink) the recording process was consciously self-contained. <em>&ldquo;We worked in a bubble&rdquo;</em>, says Adams, <em>&ldquo;Michaelson wanted to make a record that sounded like me, not me trying to do something I don&rsquo;t normally do&mdash;and all I wanted was to make a record that sounded like him recording me.&rdquo;</em><br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile the album title hints at Adams&#39;s interest in the dark arts, the lyrical content of Old Magick covers a lot of ground. Opening track &ldquo;Togetherness&rdquo; is a topical meditation on how our society treats people from other countries, set to a disarmingly pretty tune. On the upbeat &ldquo;Kings of The Back of The Bus&rdquo;, Adams contrasts the posturing of youth with the choices we make as we get older (&ldquo;Now it&rsquo;s just massage music&rdquo;.) Elsewhere, desperation is in the air, as the deluded protagonist of &ldquo;Ideas&rdquo; tries in vain to rescue a relationship gone wrong, a theme echoed by &ldquo;French Drop&rdquo;, an old conjuring term for a trick in which an object appears to disappear without having gone anywhere. The bad, sad trip of &ldquo;Sea of Words&rdquo; pilfers the phrase &ldquo;the news from nowhere&rdquo; from William Morris, former resident of Walthamstow, Adams&#39;s adopted home, while &ldquo;The Golden Bough&rdquo; is <em>&ldquo;a rock &#39;n roll song about neuroscience and the &quot;spiritual&quot; choices people make in Western culture.&rdquo;</em><br />\r\n<br />\r\nOld Magick sees Adams playing with new sounds and ideas but he has a message for fans of his earlier output: <em>&quot;I&#39;ve still got the old magic&quot;</em> he says. <em>&quot;I also have some new magic. And some crap jokes&quot;.</em><br />\r\n<br />\r\nAdams&#39; shows are wonderful to behold: funny, intimate and wildly unpredictable. According to a recent Guardian article <em>&quot;you&#39;d struggle to find a British songwriter of the last 15 years who&#39;s had such consistently good reviews.</em>&quot; A genuine entertainer, a truly gifted songwriter, and perhaps the closest thing there is to a British Bill Callahan, Adams has produced a high watermark of a record in Old Magick, proof that his reputation is deserved.</p>\r\n\r\n<div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nxe9ud-b2Kw\" width=\"560\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<p>More infos : <a href=\"http://www.stevenjamesadams.com/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.stevenjamesadams.com/</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CHORUSGIRL</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.fortunapop.com/web_images/FPOP192.jpg\" style=\"height:400px; width:400px\" /></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The brainchild of German songwriter, singer and rhythm guitarist Silvi Wersing, London-based noise pop quartet Chorusgirl blend the shimmering dreaminess of 4AD bands like Lush, the noir pop of The Cure and the bittersweet electricity of The Breeders across ten songs that sparkle with melody and pop nous but are stealthily subverted by something darker.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter several years playing in bands that either split up or fizzled out, fed up with being someone else&rsquo;s bassist and feeling like the eternal chorus girl to other people&rsquo;s dreams, Silvi Wersing decided to strike out on her own. Naming her own band with a heavy dose of irony, she recruited Udo Westhoff (bass), Michael Boyle (drums) and Diogo Oliveira (lead guitar) to flesh out the demos she had made on her laptop, polishing the recordings to a hi-fi sheen in Bear Cave Studios in Cologne.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDig beneath the surface of the perfect pop songs on Chorusgirl and you&rsquo;ll find heavy lyrics about saying goodbye, giving up, grief, alienation and loneliness. It&rsquo;s all deliberately coded though, shrouded in the metaphysical poetry that Silvi does so well. As she explains, <em>&ldquo;Most things in life are complex, so lyrics should be too. I like subversion and the non-obvious. Like the best kind of horror films.&rdquo;</em><br />\r\n<br />\r\n&ldquo;Oh, To Be A Defector&rdquo;, the catchy as hell opening track, is about &ldquo;not taking part, about not playing everyone&rsquo;s game. Of not belonging, of dropping out and of being ok with that and shouting that back at everyone&rdquo;, and takes its cue from the opening sequence of The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind; &ldquo;No Moon&rdquo; is about the death of a loved one and the intense loneliness straight afterwards; &ldquo;Girls of 1926&rdquo; is about Silvi&rsquo;s best friend: <em>&ldquo;We were like sisters, grew close, grew apart. It&rsquo;s a complex bond with unfinished business. I found a photograph of my grandmother and her best friend in the 1920s; they looked just like me and my friend. It&rsquo;s as close to a love song as I&rsquo;ll ever get, a love song to my best friend&rdquo;</em>; and &ldquo;Sweetness and Slight&rdquo;, bubbling over with barely suppressed anger, is about intense disappointment and choking someone with sweet words that are not meant in such a sweet way after all.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith their debut album Chorusgirl breathe new life into guitar pop, reinvigorating the genre with fresh hooks and sharp-edged songs full of heartache, anger and grit. No longer the eternal chorus girl to other people&rsquo;s dreams, Silvi Wersing is creating the soundtrack to her own &ndash; and perhaps her nightmares too.</p>\r\n\r\n<div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/f_7ud253Ciw\" width=\"560\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>More infos : <a href=\"https://fr-fr.facebook.com/chorusgrrrl/\" target=\"_blank\">https://fr-fr.facebook.com/chorusgrrrl/</a></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div><strong>THE SPOOK SCHOOL</strong></div>\r\n\r\n<div><br />\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.fortunapop.com/web_images/FPOP191LP.jpg\" style=\"height:425px; width:425px\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>The Spook School return in October with their brand new album, Try To Be Hopeful. Fun and empowering, Try To Be Hopeful is brim full of noisy, tuneful and triumphant queer pop songs about identity, sexuality and being awesome.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Spook School are Anna Cory (bass and vocals), Adam Todd (guitar and vocals), Nye Todd (guitar and vocals) and Niall McCamley (drums). Since forming in 2012 they&rsquo;ve become increasingly involved with the DIY queer punk scene, taking inspiration from the passionate, like-minded people they&rsquo;ve met along the way, and from bands such as Martha, Joanna Gruesome, Trust Fund and Tuff Love. Citing influences including Buzzcocks, T-Rex and the noisier end of C86, the new album is louder, bolder, fuller-sounding and captures more of their live sound&mdash;aided and abetted by producer MJ of Hookworms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Try To Be Hopeful follows The Spook School&rsquo;s critically acclaimed debut album Dress Up (2013), which received plaudits from the Guardian (which featured them as a New Band of the Day), Uncut which called it &ldquo;a rewarding, multi-layered debut&rdquo; and Loud and Quiet which said, &ldquo;this is music for the young and disillusioned, but identifiable to anyone who&rsquo;s ever been frustrated by the grievances of identity and growing up.&rdquo; The Spook School have since seen their music used on TV, having recorded the theme tune for BBC Three series &ldquo;Badults&rdquo; (Adam, Anna &amp; Niall all have sidelines in the world of comedy), and have also toured the US, where they became the subject of a Rolling Stone documentary and met Laura Jane Grace of Against Me!.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lyrically, Try To Be Hopeful is more direct than their first album, exploring issues around gender and identity, the destructive stereotypes that are generally accepted as the norm, and the difficulties of fighting them and building alternatives. Nye was undertaking his own personal journey during the making of the record too, beginning to really embrace his trans identity and starting testosterone therapy, a side effect of which meant that his voice kept changing throughout the recording process. As he explains: &ldquo;It was a bit nerve-wracking and frustrating to not be able to sing things that I&rsquo;d been able to sing easily before, but we worked with it and ended up with stuff that sounds pretty great.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Spook School are a band in the most communal sense of the word. The songwriting is split between all four members, giving a different perspective and energy to each song. &ldquo;Richard and Judy&rdquo; talks about conservatism and how easy it is to accept that this is what &ldquo;normal&rdquo; is and how schools are (as Adam explains) &ldquo;such horrible little places of enforced heteronormativity&rdquo;. The opening track, &ldquo;Burn Masculinity&rdquo; (which also features on a new Plan-It-X Records compilation), is an empowering anthem for our time that challenges male privilege. And the first single proper, &ldquo;I Want To Kiss You&rdquo;, captures the excitement and anticipation of meeting someone, thinking they&rsquo;re the most interesting person ever and not wanting to wait to see them again. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s totally about kissing people,&rdquo; concludes Nye.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perhaps the standout track is &ldquo;Binary&rdquo;, a song about questioning gender norms, something that Nye&rsquo;s experience of coming out as being trans has forced him to think about. Nye says, &ldquo;I could never understand gender when trying to think about it as a choice between &lsquo;men&rsquo; and &lsquo;women&rsquo;. What was it that separates those two types of people? When I discovered the idea of gender as something a lot messier and more nuanced than two categories, something that could be defined according to how people actually wanted to identify and place themselves, things made a lot more sense. I&rsquo;m so proud and fortunate to know quite a few amazing people who openly identify as non-binary, genderqueer or other non-binary identities - they exist in the world on their own terms and consistently challenge something that so many people just take as read, that there are men and women and nothing else.&rdquo; Celebrating life beyond the false choice between &ldquo;bowties or high heels&rdquo;, this song has quickly become a live favourite, prompting massed choruses of the &ldquo;I am bigger than a hexadecimal&rdquo; line.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Try To Be Hopeful is the sound of a band growing up, embracing their identities, and taking charge at the world. But amidst the fight for a place in society for everyone, there&rsquo;s still time for love, friendship, and fun. With their bold, fizzy and electrifying anthems, The Spook School are the shot of optimism we&rsquo;ve been hoping for.</p>\r\n\r\n<div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pNkxOOIDcCQ\" width=\"560\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<p>More infos : <a href=\"https://fr-fr.facebook.com/thespookschool/\" target=\"_blank\">https://fr-fr.facebook.com/thespookschool/</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>SIMON LOVE</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.fortunapop.com/web_images/FPOP179.jpg\" style=\"height:360px; width:360px\" /></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It Seemed like A Good Idea At The Time, the debut solo album from Simon Love, formerly of John Peel and Marc Riley favourites The Loves, is a sweary and irreverent tour de force, full of catchy hooks and offbeat lunacy. Taking its inspiration from maverick Seventies singer-songwriter Harry Nilsson and The Lovin&rsquo; Spoonful, the album features guest appearances by comedian Stewart Lee and 60s pirate radio DJ Emperor Rosko, while indiepop ensemble for hire A Little Orchestra contribute lush strings and Rob Jones of The Voluntary Butler Scheme provides brass.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDescribed recently by The Guardian as being <em>&ldquo;more early Kinks than the early Kinks&rdquo;</em>, Simon formed The Loves in Cardiff in 2000. After releasing their debut single on Radio One DJ Huw Stephens&rsquo; Boobytrap Singles Club and playing live dates supporting the Yeah Yeah Yeahs their second album Technicolor was made Album Of The Week in The Sunday Times. The band went on to play four Peel Sessions and as many for Marc Riley on BBC 6 Music before calling it a day in 2011.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFull of giant pop songs and peppered with bitter love stories about bad relationships, It Seemed like A Good Idea At The Time opens with the expletive-heavy &ldquo;**** (Is A Dirty Word)&rdquo; before moving on to jubilant lead single &ldquo;The New Adam and Eve&rdquo;, in which Simon threatens to &ldquo;punch a man in the face, with fists made out of jellyfish&rdquo; before going on to &ldquo;deny him any of my piss&rdquo;. There&rsquo;s a Paul McCartney cover version (&ldquo;Dear Boy&rdquo; from Ram), a song about the voluntary removal of Simon&rsquo;s penis (&ldquo;My Dick&rdquo;) and a song about people who fuck you around (&ldquo;Motherfuckers&rdquo;), before side one closes with the five minute long psychedelic wig-out that is &ldquo;Wowie Zowie&rdquo;.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSide two opens with the gorgeous, string-laden &ldquo;Sweetheart, You Should Probably Go To Sleep&rdquo; and the mid-paced 60s pop of &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Get The Gurl No More&rdquo; before Simon and band pull out their best Booker T groove for &ldquo;The Meaning Of Love&rdquo;, featuring comedian Stewart Lee reciting the definition of love straight from Wikipedia. This is followed by what in the late 70s would be called a rocker, &ldquo;You Kiss Your Mother With That Mouth?&rdquo;, resplendent with sax solo, before the song most likely to lead to litigation, the epic &ldquo;Elton John&rdquo;, written from the perspective of Elton John&rsquo;s ex-wife Renate. As Simon explains; <em>&ldquo;On the eve of his wedding to Renate Blauel, Elton was having three-way sex with his boyfriend &amp; a male prostitute (according to the book I read). He then invited both of them to the wedding. It can also be seen as a song about being dicked around by anyone I suppose.&rdquo;</em> The album closes with the title track &ldquo;It Seemed Like A Good Idea At The Time&rdquo;, with the album credits read out over the outro by 60s pirate radio DJ Emperor Rosko.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith this album, Simon Love has created his most cohesive collection of songs to date, welding magic melodic mischief to his knack for great songwriting and witty lyrics. Simon contends that It Seemed Like A Good Idea At The Time is likely to be the inscription on his tombstone, saying, <em>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m bound to die doing something stupid that I shouldn&rsquo;t have been doing&rdquo;</em>. More likely to land him on the radio than in the grave, Love&#39;s debut solo album is daring, unique, and definitely a good idea.</p>\r\n\r\n<div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nO7JvAhi6hU\" width=\"560\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<p>More infos : <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/SimonLoveMusic/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.facebook.com/SimonLoveMusic/</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>MAMMOTH PENGUINS</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.fortunapop.com/web_images/FPOP189.jpg\" style=\"height:300px; width:300px\" /></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hide and Seek is the debut album from Mammoth Penguins, the new band fronted by Emma Kupa, formerly of BBC 6 Music favourites Standard Fare. Due out on 10 July via Fortuna POP!, the album is an exhilarating collection of indie anthems, with Emma&#39;s candid songwriting and heartfelt vocals at the fore. Chugging away like a great lost Weezer record, the songs are bold, loud and outrageously catchy, with lyrics that hit just the right chord, exploring the burgeoning responsibilities of being in your late 20s/early 30s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the much-loved Standard Fare called it a day after nine years and two albums, Emma Kupa upped sticks and moved from Sheffield to Cambridge, where she recruited Mark Boxall (bass) and Tom Barden (drums). Previously the bassist and lead singer in Standard Fare, Emma relished the switch to guitar in Mammoth Penguins, allowing her the space to deliver her trademark soaring vocals and to indulge in the occasional mean guitar solo. With Tom&rsquo;s driving energy and Mark&rsquo;s bouncy pop bass they quickly developed their riff-tastic powerpop sound. A songwriting force of nature, Emma soon had enough songs for &quot;Hide and Seek&quot;, with enough to spare for her recently released solo mini-album Home Cinema - six songs of spirited indie-folk about family, death, drink problems, holocaust survivors and communism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recorded at Sickroom Studios in Norfolk by producer Owen Turner (Magoo, Factory Floor), Hide and Seek captures the band at the age they&#39;re at right now, reflecting on different aspects of being in their late twenties. Some songs explore the more serious side of life and relationships, such as &quot;Make a Difference&quot;, about trying to convince someone to do the right thing with you, and &quot;Postcards&quot;, a mellow number about trying to cheer up your lover. On the other hand, the jaunty &quot;March of the Penguins&quot; deals with having to act like an adult when you still feel young.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere the rip-roaring &quot;Propped Up&quot;, with call-and-response backing vocals, talks about how we&#39;re all dependent on others to distract us from negative thoughts, and the infectiously poppy &quot;The Hermit&quot; tells the story of trying to get in touch with a friend who has withdrawn from society. Other highlights include the Allo Darlin&#39;-esque &quot;Cries At The Movies&quot; with its Motown beat, about viewing tears as weakness, and the slacker-pop of &quot;Played&quot;, with its big, sing-a-long chorus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Encapsulating the album&#39;s dilemma is the final track, &quot;When I Was Your Age&quot;, a gloriously messy and loud song about feeling inadequate about one&rsquo;s achievements. As Emma explains, &quot;It started off with a birthday card from my granddad saying that he was married with kids at 28 and then I started thinking about what my parents, grandparents and family members had achieved by the time they were my age&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With Hide and Seek, Mammoth Penguins have produced a wonderfully varied record, each song a story, nuggets of joy, despair and hope. Already onto her second great band, feeling inadequate isn&#39;t something that Emma Kupa needs to do.</p>\r\n\r\n<div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"264\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PnCxtfgDrIM\" width=\"470\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<p>More infos : <a href=\"https://fr-fr.facebook.com/MammothPenguins/\" target=\"_blank\">https://fr-fr.facebook.com/MammothPenguins/</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>JOANNA GRUESOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.fortunapop.com/web_images/FPOP185.jpg\" style=\"height:360px; width:360px\" /></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Due to rising international pressure, Joanna Gruesome&rsquo;s new album Peanut Butter will finally enter the world via Fortuna POP! (UK/Japan), Slumberland (US) and Turnstile (RoW). Rival groups will be disappointed to learn that the record is a further experiment in combining hyper-melodic pop music with sonic violence. Officials have confirmed that the album contains a record number of hooks, traces of nut and elements of jangle pop, British hardcore punk, atonal music, screaming and drone organs. Yet they have issued warnings of <em>&quot;a marriage of radical politics with peanut butter spread&quot;</em>. One authorised statement reads: <em>&ldquo;Weighing in at a concise 25 minutes, the album hurtles through its ten songs, each one a succinct, powerful gem.&rdquo;</em><br />\r\n<br />\r\nLike their debut, the new album was recorded by MJ from Hookworms, with the aim of heightening the group&#39;s &quot;pop&quot; and &quot;aggressive&quot; elements to excessive and hitherto unrecorded levels. As songwriter Owen Williams explains: <em>&ldquo;We tried to make it shorter, more economical and attempted to pack as many hooks and screams in as quickly possible in order to avoid short changing the consumer or wasting her/his/their time. Lyrically it&rsquo;s more obtuse and surreal but also attempts to mock trad masculine rock themes whenever things do get more lucid. But sometimes musically we embrace them by doing embarrassing guitar solos. I&#39;m not sure how much else I&#39;m at liberty to say but one thing I will disclose is that the record is a response to threats posed by rival groups.&quot;</em><br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe record has also seen the group explore new and potentially dangerous lyrical territory. Opener Last Year is reportedly about experiencing personal tragedy and the occult in a waterpark and a pizza restaurant. Yet Jamie (Luvver) is a straightforward pop song about having a crush on someone named Jamie, queer literature and Welsh public transport. These tracks are followed by the incredibly catchy Honestly Do Yr Worst, a song about espionage, rival groups and the radical possibilities of peanut butter spread. Things become surreal on There Is No Function Stacy, a song about <em>&ldquo;someone called Stacy who wrongly believes a party is happening that she&rsquo;s been invited to. The narrator has to painfully explain to her that there was never a party and she fabricated it all&rdquo;</em>, while on Crayon Williams addresses his approach to lyrics directly. <em>&ldquo;Sometimes you can undermine hetero macho rock shit through nonsense words, obtuse statements, action, melody, sound or aesthetic rather than through traditional lyrics.&rdquo;</em><br />\r\n<br />\r\nSpeaking confidentially, one official confirms that <em>&ldquo;The sixth track, I Don&#39;t Wanna Relax, is yet another hook-filled potential single. This is swiftly followed by Jerome (Liar), a fan favourite based on a subversive folk tale.&rdquo;</em> On Separate Bedrooms, the group cover a song by Bristol DIY act Black Terror (now performing as &ldquo;CUP WINNERS&#39; CUP&rdquo;), a group known for their attention to melody. The penultimate track is the &ldquo;crushing, sparkling&rdquo; Psykick Espionage, a song about telepathy and the occult in rock&rsquo;n&rsquo;roll, and <em>&ldquo;the first time I ate an avocado&rdquo;.</em> The record is brought to a close by Hey! I Wanna Be Your Best Friend, a heartwarming number about radical friendship and Thin Lizzy appreciation. Under media interrogation, guitarist George Nicholls confesses to the themes of the record: <em>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about radical politics, fancying people and espionage. The first record was more about violence and revenge fantasy, whereas this one is more about peanut butter.&quot;</em><br />\r\n<br />\r\nComprised of Alanna McArdle (vocals), Owen Williams (guitar), Max Warren (bass), George Nicholls (guitar &amp; organ) and David Sandford (drums), the band members originally met on a wine tasting holiday. Their debut album Weird Sister took the world by storm when it was released in September 2013, and went on to win the 2014 Welsh Music Prize. Overwhelming press support saw glowing, hysterical reviews across the board with particular interest from media outlets &#39;Pitchfork&#39; and &#39;the NME&#39;. On the radio their singles have scored a remarkable four out of four on the &#39;BBC 6 Music playlist&#39; and the band have played sessions for both &#39;Lauren Laverne&#39; on &#39;6 Music&#39; and for &#39;Huw Stephens&#39; on &#39;BBC Radio One&#39;. Since the release of Weird Sister the band have been constantly hounded, surfacing from hiding only to release split singles with Bristol&rsquo;s Trust Fund and New York&rsquo;s Perfect Pussy, as well as touring with Los Campesinos!, Speedy Ortiz and Stephen Malkmus.</p>\r\n\r\n<div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hQ2VwFwDrmg\" width=\"854\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<p>More infos : <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Joanna-Gruesome/116457368434206\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.facebook.com/pages/Joanna-Gruesome/116457368434206</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>MILKY WIMPSHAKE</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.fortunapop.com/web_images/FPOP186.jpg\" style=\"height:400px; width:400px\" /></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Milky Wimpshake return with a brand new album of melodic punk indie-pop, splattered with Pete Dale&rsquo;s wry lyrics and simple, direct guitar riffs. The album features several duets with Sophie Evans, who sings on over half the songs, adding both a sweetness and a sassyness to their sound. These duets show different sides to relationships from shyness to bickering and from lust to indifference.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe album also sees a return to &ldquo;political&rdquo; (as opposed to purely romantic) concerns on songs like &lsquo;Le Revolution Politique&rsquo; &ndash; Pete&rsquo;s first ever song written in French, calling for political revolution, &lsquo;Coming Soon&rsquo; &ndash; a hymn to the messianic arrival of anarcho-socialist revolution, proposing that there can be no war but the class war, and the cover of Onsind (featuring members of Martha)&rsquo;s &lsquo;Heterosexuality is a Construct&rsquo;. As Pete explains: <em>&ldquo;The song is pretty unambiguous: love is not a crime and homophobia should never be tolerated. Ever.&rdquo;</em><br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe album title Encore, Un Effort! is an old Marxist slogan popular in France and used by, for example, Situationist Ren&eacute; Vi&eacute;net in his 1977 film Chinois, Encore Un Effort Pour Etre R&eacute;volutionnaires (One More Effort, Chinese, If You Want to be Revolutionaries). To some extent, though, the &lsquo;encore&rsquo; is Milky Wimpshake&rsquo;s: who would have thought they would still be going some twenty odd years since the first tape and 7&rdquo; singles? This LP is an added extra for the die-hards who&rsquo;ve stuck with the band &ndash; or, continuing with our french, a port manteaux for those who have never come across the band before.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMilky Wimpshake were formed by Pete in 1993 with Christine Rowe joining the band on bass in early 1994. A number of drummers have appeared over the course of half a dozen LPs, but the latest drummer Mike Walsh will hopefully be a permanent addition. The newest member of the band, Sophie Evans, wasn&rsquo;t even born when the band played their first gig but she is not the only one who has grown up coming to Milky Wimpshake shows: the band has a small but enthusiastic cult following.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe band have now been recording for Fortuna POP! for 15 years and they love the label more and more as the years pass: Pete recently declared that &ldquo;Fortuna POP! is the best label in the UK, bar none!&rdquo; and went on to say; <em>&ldquo;it is obvious that the likes of Spook School, Martha and Joanna Gruesome are amazing, thus it is an honour for the band to stay on Fortuna POP!&rdquo;</em><br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo which we say, nous vous aimons trop Milky Wimpshake!</p>\r\n\r\n<div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LuGb578Pvv4\" width=\"420\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<p>More infos : <a href=\"https://fr-fr.facebook.com/milkywimpshake/\" target=\"_blank\">https://fr-fr.facebook.com/milkywimpshake</a></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>",

But more than this, they know how to be suave - side-stepping comfortably, these assured groovologists know how to ladle up the smooth mid-tempo, the warm round bass lines having one sole and unique purpose: inducing longitudinal motion in the listeners&#39; hips.</p>\r\n\r\n<div>Above all, thanks to the surplus of starry-eyed girls, and the fact that they find rainy days at the seaside as moving as a Michael Bay film, they&#39;ve also learnt to slip in some minor chords.

To fans of Allah Las, Black Lips, Holy Golightly, King Tuff, The Kinks, Shannon and The Clams or Electric Prunes, you would be sorely wrong to abstain.

Apr&egrave;s les excellents <strong>Madcaps, Los Dos Hermanos, Dusty Mush, Kaviar Special, Volage, Mountain Bike</strong> (pour ne citer que quelques groupes), voici le 1er album d&rsquo;un one man band lillois qui se nomme <strong>Wild Raccoon</strong>. Ce jeune gar&ccedil;on &agrave; la chevelure blonde (qui signe ses compos sous le nom de <strong>Raton Sauvage</strong>), r&eacute;alise une musique lo-fi et garage avec un soup&ccedil;on de surf et de grunge des plus efficaces. La couleur bleu ciel de la pochette colle &agrave; merveille &agrave; la musique sixties qui donne la banane (comme celui du label) aux jambes &eacute;lastiques. La plage au sable fin n&rsquo;est pas loin&hellip; La guitare sonne divinement bien. Entre les riffs parfois graisseux et la ligne claire et pop, entre le son, les m&eacute;lodies et la voix, le r&eacute;sultat (malgr&eacute; les moyens artisanaux), donne des compos tr&egrave;s riches, en format technicolor et 3D. A lui seul, <strong>Wild Raccoon</strong>, fait sonner sa petite entreprise comme un trio (fa&ccedil;on <strong>The Jam</strong>) bien soud&eacute;. A son contact, tous les &eacute;l&eacute;ments sonores sont en totale &eacute;bullition. Le sommet est atteint avec <em>Friens&rsquo;n&rsquo; Chocolate</em> qui cl&ocirc;ture l&rsquo;album. Ce titre bien allum&eacute; sent l&rsquo;odeur de l&rsquo;herbe, nous installe dans un voyage psych&eacute;, duquel on ne d&eacute;sire pas revenir. Avec un tel 1er album, il est fort &agrave; parier que <strong>Wild Raccoon</strong> va faire parler de lui dans les mois qui viennent. Une valeur s&ucirc;re &agrave; suivre de tr&egrave;s pr&egrave;s. Enfin &agrave; noter que l&rsquo;album est &eacute;galement &eacute;dit&eacute; en K7.<br />\r\nAvec des disques de cette qualit&eacute;, <em>Howlin&#39; Banana</em> est sur le chemin des labels tels qu&rsquo;<em>In The Red, Captured Tracks, Sacred Bones, Trouble In Mind</em> et <em>Born Bad</em>.</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1OfB1ynlXt4\" width=\"560\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>More infos : <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/wildraccoonstripedtail\">https://www.facebook.com/wildraccoonstripedtail</a></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div><strong>THE SOAP OPERA</strong></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://f1.bcbits.com/img/a3039766572_16.jpg\" style=\"height:700px; width:700px\" /></strong></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>Groupe d&#39;indie pop rennais fond&eacute; par quatre musiciens issus des groupes Sudden Death of Stars et Slim Wild Boar &amp; His Forsaken Shadow.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUne pop un peu chill-out mais aussi un peu punky, ou latin, ou bossa, surann&eacute;e parfois, accrocheuse toujours.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBon bon, c&#39;est tout je crois.</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VywFnXt32Bg\" width=\"560\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>More infos : <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/thesoapoperaband/timeline?ref=page_internal\">https://www.facebook.com/thesoapoperaband/timeline?ref=page_internal</a></div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>",

Is a surf-instro project led by El Sentenza, former banjo player from the Legendary Kid Combo, together with Marla&rsquo;O, guitar player from the all-female Italian garage queens The Cleopatras. This project was born at the beginning of last summer &lsquo;13, with the help of Barba San, from the Italian beat band The Albinos, Cecilia Ann, famous bass based indie-pendent songwriter and Mimmi, one of the best and eclectic jazz drummers of the Garda Lake area. The former idea was to create a standard surf combo, then after a couple of weeks in the basement, the project took a different shape, mixing the musical tastes of all the musicians involved. The original surf sound took a different direction, moving towards the surf revival of the 90&rsquo;s, the garage beat revival, and the traditional Oriental melodies from the Far East area. All the imaginary and the artwork was inspired by the oriental Z movies, martial arts and fancied mysterious stories from ancient east. The band wear original Kung Fu kimonos and the (dragon) ladies are dressed like famous almond eyed movies star actresses. Main influences are bands like The Bomboras, Ghastly Ones, Satan&rsquo;s Pilgrims, mixed with The Ventures, Takeshi Terauchi, The Fuzztones, Gravedigger V, Roky Erikson, The Pixies, The Cramps, Link Wray, Johnny Thunders, Dick Dale, Question Mark and the Mysterians...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis first rate Italian Garage/Surf band comes with their own brand of wyld instrumental kink, mixed the influences of The Bomboras, Fuzztones, The Ventures and Dick Dale with bloody Far East vibes.

Their sound creates a cinematic surf experience like it was made for some lost 70&#39;s Hong Kong Kung-Fu flick, alternative soundtrack for &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; or some Takashi Miike KILLER extravaganza. One of the best new surfin&#39; stuff I heard lately, so don&#39;t you dare miss it! Say...

Not the most likely place for a band to emerge with the obvious surfing pedigree of El Ray. The band show a versatility of sound and an ear for catchy, toe tapping melody which takes them beyond the cliches that can often be associated with the surfing genre. Combining a fresh, modern style with a healthy nod to the past, &#39;surf with a twist&#39; El Ray have managed to achieve a new, classic sound.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTheir 3 full length releases, the two 10&quot; inches and the singles are known to have been recorded during blizzards, far far away from the sunny side of life and Californian lifestyle. Whatever it is, El Ray is the band that keeps on giving that goosebumbing and hair raising Instro-surf!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEl Ray&#39;s merits has proved the band to be a serious contender in writing and performing modern instrumentals that would make your hifi-stereo A GO-GO!! The 4 Scandinavian Instro-surfers have build their own brand within the surfing circles since 2001. Mixing their dynamic, cool punked up surf tunes with a huge spoonful of rock&#39;n&#39;roll and a tad indie to make everybody happy when &quot;it&#39;s better to be surf than sorry&quot;.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEl Ray are always ready to invite their audience to ride the wild waves of surf in clubs all over.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBetter Surf Than Sorry - it&#39;s time to join the party!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JwgfzvNyHoU\" width=\"560\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More infos : <a href=\"http://elray.dk\">http://elray.dk</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>INSECT SURFERS</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://f1.bcbits.com/img/a0101415081_2.jpg\" style=\"height:350px; width:350px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This surfadelic stereophonic shocker comes pressed up as an ultra limited 300 only green splatter wax variant (the CD and download versions come fleshed out with 4 additional bonus cuts) via the adored Green Cookie imprint and features the latest bad boogie from the Insect Surfers titled &ldquo;Infra Green&rdquo;. On and off since the late 70&rsquo;s these dudes fronted up by David Arnson have been breaking the surf twang rule book for over thirty years cross wiring the predictable trademark signatures fusing elements of punk and psych to craft out soundtracks for films yet to be conceived yet alone scored. Amid the riff rumbles gouged amid these grooves the unmistakable signature glide of Will Sergeant albeit appreciably fed speed is evident on the opening power popping surge of &ldquo;Bay of Bengal&rdquo; while had Gerry Anderson been western minded as opposed to being sci-fi fascinated then the cool shimmer toning Link Wray meets smoked out Johnny Kidd stylings of &ldquo;DelMarVa&rdquo; would have headed up the kind of sonic templates being primed into the minds of the late 60&rsquo;s kids by Barry Gray. Elsewhere &ldquo;Orion Canyon&rdquo; imagines some secret studio soiree forged by Neil Young and Johnny Marr while those of you missing your one time regular intake of man or astro man grooviness should venture forth at pace to the rampant &ldquo;Sea Scorpion&rdquo; ? thoroughly recommended and something that&rsquo;ll be visited upon again once we nail hard copies.
